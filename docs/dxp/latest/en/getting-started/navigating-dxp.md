# Navigating DXP

Liferay DXP's out-of-the-box navigation is organized into three major areas: the _Personal Menu_, _Global Menu_, and _Site Menu_.

## Site Menu

The DXP _Site Menu_ on the left side of the screen contains actions, content, and configurations that are scoped to the specific site that is being currently viewed. The Site Menu may be hidden until you expand it by clicking the icon ( ![Site Menu icon](../images/icon-menu.png) ) at the upper-left corner of the screen.

![Expand the Site Menu so that all options are visible.](./navigating-dxp/images/05.png)

```note::
   The *Site Menu* indicates which site you are working with when using the Site Menu. In this example the Site is `Liferay`. You may change what site you are working with by clicking the Compass Icon in the Site Menu.
```

The following common site building and management activities can be done in the _Site Menu_:

* [Adding Pages](../site-building/creating-pages/adding-pages/adding-a-page-to-a-site.md)
* [Creating Content](../content_authoring_and_management.html)
* [Managing Site Memberships](../site-building/building-sites/site-membership/adding-members-to-sites.md)
* [Configuring and Optimizing Site Behavior and Functionality](../site_building.html)
* And more...

## Applications Bar

The _Application Bar_ appears across the different pages and applications in the [Site Menu](#site-menu). The Application Bar shows an Actions (![Actions](../images/icon-actions.png)) menu with different options, depending on the application that is open at the moment.

When you open a Page in view mode, the available tools in the Applications Bar change depending on the Page type.

```note::

Page Audit is available starting with Liferay DXP 7.4. The Toggle Controls option is available starting with Liferay DXP 7.3.
```

## Personal Menu

The Personal Menu is the hub for information and activities for a User that is logged in.

![The Liferay DXP Personal Menu is available by clicking the avatar icon in the top right.](./navigating-dxp/images/01.png)

Users can use the personal menu to:

* [Change account information](./introduction-to-the-admin-account.md#changing-account-information) (Name, Password, etc.)
* [See what sites they are members of](../site-building/building-sites/site-membership/adding-members-to-sites.md)
* [Review site notifications](../collaboration-and-social/notifications-and-requests/user-guide/managing-notifications-and-requests.md)
* [Sign out](./introduction-to-the-admin-account.md#signing-out)
* And more...

## Global Menu

The DXP _Global Menu_ contains the _Applications Menu_ and the _Control Panel_. Click the _Applications Menu_ icon (![Applications Menu icon](../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) at the top of the screen to access it.

```note::
   By default, Users with the *Guest* or *User* roles are not able to access the Global Menu.
```

You can also navigate to other Sites available to you from either the _Applications_ or _Control Panel_ tabs in the _Global Menu_, on the right side.

### Applications Menu

The _Applications Menu_ contains a variety of links to manage many different applications within your Liferay DXP server.

![The Applications Menu contains many global settings and important functions applicable to all sites.](./navigating-dxp/images/02.png)

Here are some of the applications that can be managed from the _Applications Menu_:

* [Collections](../content-authoring-and-management/collections-and-collection-pages/about-collections-and-collection-pages.md) and the Content Dashboard
* [Workflow](../process-automation/workflow/introduction-to-workflow.md)

### Control Panel

The _Control Panel_ contains general administrative actions and configurations that can be scoped _globally_ to the Liferay DXP installation or to a particular instance.

![The Control Panel is now part of the Global menu.](./navigating-dxp/images/04.png)

The following common administrative activities can be done in the Control Panel:

## DXP 7.1 and 7.2

In Liferay DXP versions prior to 7.3, all of the contents of the Global Menu are instead contained within the Control Panel. The Control Panel itself is located above the Site Menu on the left side of the screen in these versions.
