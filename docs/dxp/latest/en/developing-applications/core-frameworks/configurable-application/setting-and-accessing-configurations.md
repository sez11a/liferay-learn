# Setting and Accessing Configurations

You can use Liferay's configuration framework to add a settings UI for a MVC Portlet.

## See the Example Portlet

1. Start Liferay DXP. If you don't already have a docker container, use

    ```bash
    docker run -it -p 8080:8080 [$LIFERAY_LEARN_DXP_DOCKER_IMAGE$]
    ```
1. Download and unzip [Setting and Accessing Configurations](./liferay-e3q3.zip).

    ```bash
    curl https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/latest/en/developing-applications/core-frameworks/configurable-application/liferay-e3q3.zip -O
    ```

    ```bash
    unzip liferay-e3q3.zip
    ```

1. From the module root, build and deploy.

    ```bash
    ./gradlew deploy -Ddeploy.docker.container.id=$(docker ps -lq)
    ```

    ```note::
       This command is the same as copying the deployed jars to /opt/liferay/osgi/modules on the Docker container.
    ```

1. Confirm the deployment in the Liferay Docker container console.

    ```
    STARTED com.acme.e3q3.web.0.0 [1650]
    ```

1. Verify that the example module is working. Open your browser to `https://localhost:8080`

1. Add the E3Q3 Portlet to a page. You can find the example portlet under Sample Widgets.

    ![Add the E3Q3 Portlet to a page.](./setting-and-accessing-configurations/images/01.png)

    The UI shows a welcome message along with the three configurable attributes: font color, font family, and font size.

1. To change the configuration, navigate to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings*. Under Platform click *Third Party*. Click the name of the sample application on the left.

    ![Click the name of the application in the Third Party list.](./setting-and-accessing-configurations/images/02.png)

    Try entering a different font color, font family, and font size. Click the *Update* button and go back to your page with the published widget. Verify that the attributes have changed.

Here's how the configuration framework works.

## Creating the Configuration Interface

Defining configurable attributes in a configuration interface is enough to generate a configuration UI in [System Settings](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/system-settings.md). It also defines the configurable attributes. 

In the sample project, the `E3Q3WebConfiguration.java` file is the configuration interface. 

```{literalinclude} ./setting-and-accessing-configurations/resources/liferay-e3q3.zip/e3q3-web/src/main/java/com/acme/e3q3/web/internal/configuration/E3Q3WebConfiguration.java
   :language: java
   :lines: 5-17
```

Note, for this interface no scope is defined, so the configuration scope is set automatically to `SYSTEM`.

The interface has three configurable attributes: font color, font family, and font size. Note that color and family are type `string` and size is type `int`.

`Meta.OCD` registers this class as a configuration with a specific ID. 

```important::
    Note that the ID must be the fully qualified class name (FQCN) of the configuration interface.
```

`Meta.AD` specifies [optional metadata](http://bnd.bndtools.org/chapters/210-metatype.html) about the attribute such as a default value or whether the attribute is a required field. Note that if an attribute value is required but a default is not set, an administrator must set a value in settings for the application to work properly.

Next, see how the configuration is read by the MVC Portlet.

## Reading the Configuration from the Application

1. In the `@Component` annotation, the configuration interface class is specified with the `configurationPid`:

    ```java
    configurationPid = "com.acme.e3q3.web.internal.configuration.E3Q3WebConfiguration"
    ```

1. The `activate()` method has an `@Activate` annotation that invokes the method as soon as the app is started. The `@Modified` annotation ensures the method is invoked whenever the configuration is updated.

    ```{literalinclude} ./setting-and-accessing-configurations/resources/liferay-e3q3.zip/e3q3-web/src/main/java/com/acme/e3q3/web/internal/portlet/E3Q3Portlet.java
        :dedent: 1
        :language: java
        :lines: 44-51
    ```

    The `activate()` method calls the `ConfigurableUtil.createConfigurable()` method to convert a map of the configuration's attributes to a typed class. The configuration is stored in a private field. Now this field can be used to retrieve configuration values or set values.

1. A configuration object is added to the request object so its values can be read from a JSP. 

    ```{literalinclude} ./setting-and-accessing-configurations/resources/liferay-e3q3.zip/e3q3-web/src/main/java/com/acme/e3q3/web/internal/portlet/E3Q3Portlet.java
        :dedent: 1
        :language: java
        :lines: 33-42
    ``` 

    The configuration can now be read from the request of the application's JSP.

## Accessing the Configuration from a JSP

1. The following import statement adds the configuration interface to the JSP: 

    ```markup
    <%@ page import="com.acme.e3q3.web.internal.configuration.E3Q3WebConfiguration" %>
    ```

1. The configuration object from the request object is obtained and the configuration values are read.

    ```markup
    <%
    E3Q3WebConfiguration e3q3WebConfiguration = (E3Q3WebConfiguration)request.getAttribute(E3Q3WebConfiguration.class.getName());
    %>
    ```

1. The attributes `fontColor()`, `fontFamily()`, `fontSize()` can now be used in the JSP. 

## Implementing a Dropdown Selection UI

The sample project has three attributes that can be configured. Currently the attributes must be manually entered into a text input field, but this can be further customized.

For example, you can use a dropdown list for the font family attribute instead of an input field. In the project's configuration interface, replace the `@Meta.AD` annotation with this:

```java
@Meta.AD(
	optionLabels = {"Arial", "Georgia", "Helvetica", "Tahoma", "Verdana"},
	optionValues = {"arial", "georgia", "helvetica", "tahoma", "verdana"},
required = false)
```

Redeploy the example module.

![The font familly is now a dropdown selection.](./setting-and-accessing-configurations/images/03.png)

Now the font family attribute is a dropdown selection.
