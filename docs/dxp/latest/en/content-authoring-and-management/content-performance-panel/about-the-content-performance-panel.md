# About the Content Performance Panel

> Available: Liferay 7.3+.

The *Content Performance* panel is a global application for analyzing performance metrics of your content, like traffic channels or the number of views and reads over time. Using the Content Performance panel, content teams can periodically assess and adapt their content strategy.

To learn how to analyze your content performance quantitatively using the Content Performance panel, see [Analyze Content Metrics Using the Content Performance panel](./analyze-content-metrics-using-content-performance-panel.md).

```note::
   To manage and audit your content across Sites and Asset Libraries, use the `Content Dashboard <../content-dashboard/about-the-content-dashboard.md>`_.
```

## Accessing the Content Performance Panel

You can open the Content Performance panel from [Web Content](#accessing-the-content-performance-panel-from-web-content) or from the [Content Dashboard](#accessing-the-content-performance-panel-from-the-content-dashboard) using *View Metrics* (![View Metrics](../../images/icon-analytics.png)).

You can access the Content Performance panel when the following conditions are met:

- You have View and Edit permissions for the content.
- The content is based on a [Display Page Template](../../site-building/displaying-content/using-display-page-templates/about-display-page-templates-and-display-pages.md).
- The Liferay DXP instance has an active [connection to Liferay Analytics Cloud](https://learn.liferay.com/analytics-cloud/latest/en/connecting-data-sources/connecting-liferay-dxp-to-analytics-cloud.html) and your site is synchronized.

```note::
   The *Metrics* option for your content is available when these conditions are met (2). If the *Metrics* option is unavailable, one or more conditions are not met (1).
```
