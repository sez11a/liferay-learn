# Defining Metadata Sets

With Documents and Media, you can define reusable groups of metadata fields that can be added to custom Document Types. Once created, these Metadata Sets can be selected while [creating or editing a Document Type](./defining-document-types.md) and are added after any fields defined directly in the Document Type form.

Follow these steps to define a new Metadata Set.

1. Navigate to the Documents and Media application in a Site or Asset Library.

   To access Documents and Media in a Site, open the *Site Menu* (![Site Menu](../../../../images/icon-product-menu.png)) and go to *Content & Data* &rarr; *Documents and Media*.

   ![Click on Documents and Media under Content & Data in the Site Menu.](./defining-metadata-sets/images/01.png)

   To access Documents and Media in an Asset Library, simply navigate to any Library where it's enabled, and click on *Documents and Media*.

   ![Click on Documents and Media in the Asset Library.](./defining-metadata-sets/images/02.png)

1. Click on the *Metadata Sets* tab.

1. Click the *Add* button (![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) to access the New Metadata Sets form.

1. Enter a *name* for the Metadata Set.

1. In the *Builder* tab, drag and drop the desired fields into the designated drop zone.

   ![Add fields in the Builder tab.](./defining-metadata-sets/images/03.png)

   Each field is highly configurable, with Basic and Advanced options. If desired, you can create field groups by dragging and dropping fields on top of one another. These groups can also be configured.

   ![Configure each field.](./defining-metadata-sets/images/04.png)

1. (Optional) Click on the *Properties* tab, and enter a *description*.

1. Click on *Save*.

Once saved, the new Metadata Set can be accessed and selected when creating or editing Document Types. See [Defining Document Types](./defining-document-types.md) or more information.

### Editing Metadata Sets

You can edit your fields to reflect their intended metadata. For example, a text field's default label is *Text*. If you want to use the text field as a title, for instance, then you should change the field's label to *Title*. Besides the Label field, you can also configure the default values, variable names, mouse-over tips, widths, and other settings. Some fields have a *Required* setting for specifying whether users must populate the field. If a field's *Repeatable* setting is *Yes*, users can add multiple consecutive instances of the field to the document's metadata.

1. Click on the field on the canvas. This automatically selects the *Settings* tab on the left.
1. To edit a setting value, double-click it in the Settings table and enter the new value.
