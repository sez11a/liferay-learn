# Documents and Media Overview

The Documents and Media application is used to store and manage files for your Liferay instance. This includes files uploaded directly to Documents and Media as well as those uploaded in applications that support file attachments. It serves as a virtual, shared drive for your users and can store any type of files.

```note::
   Documents and Media is available in all Sites and can be enabled in `Asset Libraries <../asset-libraries/asset-libraries-overview.md>`_. Files have different scopes depending on whether they're uploaded to Documents and Media in a Site or Asset Library. Files uploaded in a Site are scoped to that Site and cannot be readily accessed by other Sites in your DXP instance. However, files uploaded in an Asset Library are available globally and can be linked to multiple Sites for ready access.
```

Search, filter, and organize digital assets and folders with ease via the Liferay UI. Alternatively, use [WebDAV](./publishing-and-sharing/accessing-documents-with-webdav.md) to access your documents from your system's file manager.

All uploaded files are stored in your designated [file storage system](../../system-administration/file-storage/configuring-file-storage.md). By default, Documents and Media uses the [Simple File System Store](../../system-administration/file-storage/other-file-store-types/simple-file-system-store.md), though you can configure your instance to use an alternate file store (e.g., [DBStore](../../system-administration/file-storage/other-file-store-types/dbstore.md), [Google Cloud Store](../../system-administration/file-storage/other-file-store-types/google-cloud-storage.md), [Amazon S3 Store](../../system-administration/file-storage/other-file-store-types/amazon-s3-store.md)).

Documents and Media integrations can be configure to [automatically generate previews](./devops/configuring-document-previews.md) for files when uploaded or updated.

Integrate Documents and Media with [Microsoft Office 365](./devops/enabling-document-creation-and-editing-with-microsoft-office-365.md), [OpenOffice](./devops/enabling-openoffice-libreoffice-integration.md), [Google Drive](./devops/google-drive-integration/enabling-links-to-google-drive-documents.md), and other applications to provide additional functionality in the Liferay UI.

You can also [enable Liferay Workflow](../../process-automation/workflow/using-workflows/activating-workflow.md#activating-workflow-for-specific-applications) for Documents and Media to help manage asset publishing and version updates. When enabled, documents must be reviewed before they are published.

If desired, you can [export](../../site-building/building-sites/importing-exporting-pages-and-content.md) Documents and Media assets as Liferay Archive (`LAR`) files. These files can be used as backups or to import your assets into another Site or Asset Library.

Files added to Documents and Media can be displayed in applications that support attachments (e.g., Web Content, Message Boards), Page Fragments, and widgets (e.g., [Media Gallery](./publishing-and-sharing/publishing-documents-on-a-dxp-site/using-the-media-gallery-widget.md)).
