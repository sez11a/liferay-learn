# Enabling FFmpeg for Audio and Video Previews

Documents and Media provides integration with the [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) multimedia framework for generating audio and video file previews. To use this integration, you must first install FFmpeg on your server. If you're working in a clustered environment, it must be installed on each node.  

```note::
   Previously, Liferay used Xuggler to generate video and audio previews. However, the Xuggler library is currently unmaintained. As of Liferay 7.4, users are advised to use FFmpeg for generating previews.
```

Once installed, follow these steps to configure Documents and Media to use FFmpeg:

1. Open the *Global Menu* (![Global Menu](../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), and go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Documents and Media*.

1. Go to *FFMPEG Audio Converter*, check *Enable*, and click *Update*.

1. Go to *FFMPEG Video Converter*, check *Enable*, and click *Update*.

   If FFmpeg is installed correctly on your system, Liferay displays a success message after clicking Update. Otherwise, Liferay displays an error message.

Once configured, audio and video previews are automatically generated for audio and video files at upload or update.
