# Changing Site Membership Type

A Site's membership type determines how freely users may join your Site. There are three types of site membership:

- **Open:** Users can join and leave whenever they want. The Site is visible to all users in the My Sites app.

- **Restricted:** Site is visible in the My Sites application, and users must request membership to join.

- **Private:** A Site Administrator must explicitly invite a User to join and then add them to the Site. Private membership Sites don't appear in the My Sites app.
