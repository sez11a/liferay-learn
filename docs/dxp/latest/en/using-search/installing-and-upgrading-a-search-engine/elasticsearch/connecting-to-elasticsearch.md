# Connecting to Elasticsearch

After [setting up Elasticsearch](./installing-elasticsearch.md), you must connect Liferay to it using the Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch. Connection steps depend on the [connector](#available-liferay-elasticsearch-connectors) you're configuring:

* Liferay 7.3: Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch is included in the Liferay DXP 7.3 and CE 7.3 GA4+. It's also available on [Liferay Marketplace](../../../system-administration/installing-and-managing-apps/getting-started/using-marketplace.md).
* Liferay 7.2: Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch is available on [Liferay Marketplace](../../../system-administration/installing-and-managing-apps/getting-started/using-marketplace.md).

Notable installation and configuration procedure differences are presented here. 

```important::
   Stop each Liferay server node before configuring the connection.
```

If you're on Liferay 7.2, skip to [Liferay 7.2: Installing Elasticsearch 7 Connector](#liferay-7-2-installing-elasticsearch-7-connector).

## Configuring the Connector

The Elasticsearch 7 connector is configured for Liferay 7.3 via a configuration file named `com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config`. 

After specifying the configuration in the file, you can deploy it by placing it into your `[Liferay Home]/osgi/configs/` folder.

For Docker,

```bash
docker cp ~/path/to/com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config [container]:/mnt/liferay/files
```

Alternatively, you can configure the connector in the user interface. In the Global Menu (![Global Menu](../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)), go to Control Panel &rarr; System Settings and open the _Search_ category. The entry is called Elasticsearch 7.

> In Liferay 7.2, The Control Panel is in the Product Menu (![Product Menu](../../../images/icon-product-menu.png)).

A simple 7.3 connector configuration enables production mode (`productionModeEnabled="true"`) and sets the URL to each Elasticsearch node (`networkHostAddresses=["http://es-node:9200"]`).

1. Create the following configuration file:

    ```bash
    com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config
    ```

1. Specify the configuration properties in the `.config` file. Here's an example that includes [security properties](./securing-elasticsearch.md) commented out (note that you'd need to use `https` network host addresses when encryption is enabled):

    ```properties
    # In CE/DXP7.3, productionModeEnabled replaces operationMode (deprecated):
    productionModeEnabled=B"true"
    networkHostAddresses=["http://es-node1:9200","http://es-node3:9201","http://es-node3:9202"]
    # In CE/DXP 7.3 the security settings are included in the ElasticsearchConfiguration
    # In CE/DXP 7.2 the security settings go in com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.XPackSecurityConfiguration.config
    # Authentication
    #authenticationEnabled=B"true"
    #username="elastic"
    #password="liferay"

    # TLS/SSL
    #networkHostAddresses=["https://es-node1:9200","https://es-node3:9201","https://es-node3:9202"]
    #httpSSLEnabled=B"true"
    #truststoreType="pkcs12"
    #trustStorePath="/PATH/TO/elastic-nodes.p12"
    #trustStorePassword="liferay"

    # Highly recommended for all non-prodcution usage (e.g., practice, tests, diagnostics):
    #logExceptionsOnly="false"
    ```

1. Place the `.config` file in your `[Liferay Home]/osgi/configs` folder.


```tip::
   The connectors contain many configuration settings. See the `Elasticsearch Connector Settings <./elasticsearch-connector-settings.md>`_ for their definitions. Most of the configurations correspond to settings available in `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/index.html>`_.
```

To refer to Elasticsearch servers by name, map each Elasticsearch server name to its IP address in your DNS or your Liferay server's `/etc/hosts` file.

```tip::
  The network host address format is ``http[s]://[host name]:[port]``. If you're using a Liferay Docker container, you can use ``--add-host [host name]:[IP address]`` options with your ``docker run`` command to map a host name to each Elasticsearch server IP address. The port is defined in the Elasticsearch container's docker run command as the first value of the ``-p 1234:5678`` option (it's ``1234`` in this case). If you're running a local test environment without HTTPS enabled, all the addresses can be ``http://localhost:port``. See `Docker's documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#managing-etchosts>`_ for more details.
```

## Liferay 7.2: Installing Elasticsearch 7 Connector

### Stop the Elasticsearch 6 Connector

On Liferay 7.2, the bundled connector application and APIs are for Elasticsearch 6. These must be disabled before installing the Elasticsearch 7 connector.

1. Create a file called

    ```
    com.liferay.portal.bundle.blacklist.internal.BundleBlacklistConfiguration.config
    ```

1. Add this content to the file:

    ```properties
    blacklistBundleSymbolicNames=[ \
    	"com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.api", \
    	"com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.impl", \
    	"com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.spi", \
    	"com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.xpack.security.impl", \
    	"Liferay Connector to X-Pack Security [Elastic Stack 6.x] - Impl", \
    	"Liferay Enterprise Search Security - Impl.lpkg" \
    ]
    ```

1. Place the file in your `[Liferay Home]/osgi/configs` folder.

    When you start the Liferay server (not yet), Liferay reads this file and blocks the declared bundles from starting.

    ```tip::
      **Docker:** ``Liferay Home`` and other important folders of a Liferay installation are accessed in a Docker container at ``/mnt/liferay`` as described `here <../../../installation-and-upgrades/installing-liferay/using-liferay-docker-images/container-lifecycle-and-api.md#api>`_. You can use ``docker cp /path/to/local/file [container_name]:/mnt/liferay/files/osgi/configs`` to place configuration files into the container. Later, you can use ``docker cp`` to deploy the Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch 7 LPKG file.
    ```

### Install the Elasticsearch 7 Connector

1. Download the Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch 7.

   Make sure the connector corresponds to your Elasticsearch version. Note, the client libraries in the connector can be for an older version of Elasticsearch (e.g., 7.3) even though the connector application supports a newer version (e.g., 7.9.x). Liferay tests the connector with every minor Elasticsearch version and creates new update connector versions when needed. As always, consult the [Search Engine Compatibility Matrix](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016511651) for connector compatibility.

   * CE: [Liferay CE Connector to Elasticsearch 7](https://web.liferay.com/en/marketplace/-/mp/application/170642090)
   * DXP: [Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch 7](https://web.liferay.com/en/marketplace/-/mp/application/170390307)

1. [Install the LPKG](../../../system-administration/installing-and-managing-apps/installing-apps/installing-apps.md) by placing it in the folder

   ```bash
   [Liferay Home]/deploy
   ```

   For Docker,

   ```bash
   docker cp ~/path/to/Liferay\ Connector\ to\ Elasticsearch.lpkg [container]:/mnt/liferay/deploy
   ```

   When you start the Liferay server (not yet), Liferay deploys the LPKG.

You're ready to configure the connector.

### Configure the Connector for Liferay 7.2

1. Create the following Elasticsearch configuration file:

    ```bash
    com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config
    ```

1. Specify the configuration properties in the `.config` file. Here's an example that enables remote operation mode, sets the transport address for each Elasticsearch node, and identifies the connection you're configuring:

    ```properties
    # com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config
    operationMode="REMOTE"
    transportAddresses="ip.of.elasticsearch.node:9300"
    # Highly recommended for all non-production usage (e.g., practice, tests, diagnostics):
    #logExceptionsOnly="false"
    ```

1. Deploy the configuration by placing the `.config` file in your `[Liferay Home]/osgi/configs` folder.

You're ready to start Liferay.

## Start Liferay and Re-Index

If Elasticsearch is [installed and running](./installing-elasticsearch.md), start Liferay. In the Control Panel, navigate to Configuration &rarr; Search and verify the Elasticsearch connection is active.

![An active connection is displayed in the Search administrative panel.](./getting-started-with-elasticsearch/images/01.png)

Re-index the search indexes and spell check indexes for each Virtual Instance. Invoke both of these actions in the Virtual Instance's Index Actions tab of Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr; Search.

On Liferay 7.3, Re-index the [Workflow Metrics](../../../process-automation/workflow/using-workflows/using-workflow-metrics.md) indexes from the Workflow Metrics Settings window: 

1. From the Global Menu (![Applications Menu](../../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)) navigate to Applications &rarr; Workflow Metrics. 

1. Open the _Settings_ window from the App Options menu (![App Options](../../../images/icon-app-options.png)).

1. Click _Reindex All_.

```note::
   If you have Elasticsearch indexes used for primary data storage (storing data not backed by a database) you can bring that data into your new Elasticsearch cluster using the `snapshot and restore approach <./upgrading-elasticsearch/backing-up-elasticsearch.md>`__. Liferay's own Search Tuning indexes (for Result Rankings and Synyonyms) are primary storage indexes.
```

Now Liferay is indexing content into your remote Elasticsearch 7 installation.

## Available Liferay Elasticsearch Connectors

The bundled connector to Elasticsearch is not always the best choice for your installation. It's important to understand the differences between the connectors you can use to communicate with Elasticsearch:

| Liferay CE/DXP Version | Name | Availability | Communication Protocol | Supports Secure Connection | Operation Modes |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| CE 7.3 GA4+, DXP 7.3 GA1+ | Liferay (CE) Connector to Elasticsearch 7 | Bundled | [HTTP](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/7.x/java-rest-overview.html) | &#10004; | Sidecar / Remote (Production)\* |
| CE 7.2, DXP 7.2 | Liferay Connector (CE) to Elasticsearch 6 | Bundled | [Transport](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/6.x/transport-client.html) | &#10004;\*\* (requires [LES](https://www.liferay.com/products/dxp/enterprise-search)) | Embedded / Remote |
| CE 7.2, DXP 7.2 | Liferay Connector (CE) to Elasticsearch 7 (v3.x) | Marketplace: [CE](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/170642090), [DXP](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/170390307) | [Transport](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/7.x/transport-client.html) | &#10004; |  Embedded / Remote |

\* The connector configuration's _Operation Mode_ (`operationMode`) setting is  deprecated and replaced with _Production Mode Enabled_ (`productionModeEnabled`).

\*\* Through the [Liferay Enterprise Search Security](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace/-/mp/application/106163963) application.

For detailed compatibility information, including the compatible Elasticsearch versions and required patch levels, see the [Search Engine Compatibility Matrix](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016511651).

## What's Next 

Now that Liferay is connected to Elasticsearch, you can start using Elasticsearch. For production, you should secure communication between your Liferay and Elasticsearch servers. See [Securing Elasticsearch](./securing-elasticsearch.md) for more information.
