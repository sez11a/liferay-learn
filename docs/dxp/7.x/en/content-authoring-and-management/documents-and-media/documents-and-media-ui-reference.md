# Documents and Media UI Reference

This article serves as a reference guide to the _Documents and Media_ menu. Navigate to the _Site Administration_ &rarr; _Content & Data_ &rarr; _Documents and Media_.

![The Documents and Media menu is found in the Site Administration.](./documents-and-media-ui-reference/images/01.png)

There are three tabs: _Documents and Media_, _Document Types_, and _Metadata Sets_.

## Documents and Media Tab

The _Documents and Media_ Tab's Home screen displays all the folders and documents on that site. This is the Root folder. Here, users can upload a single document or multiple documents, add a new folder, add a new Repository (for example, Sharepoint), or a new shortcut.

Click the (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) to begin using the _Documents and Media_ application.

![Click the add icon then a selection to begin populating the Documents and Media app.](./documents-and-media-ui-reference/images/04.png)

## Document Types Tab

_Document Types_ are made of metadata fields that users fill out to and help define the purpose of Document Library files. They provide additional, searchable information about uploaded documents.

![The Document Types Tab contains all Document Types which contain metadata sets.](./documents-and-media-ui-reference/images/02.png)

Click the (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) to create a new Document Type.

To learn more about using Document Types, see [Defining Document Types](./uploading-and-managing/managing-metadata/defining-document-types.md).

## Metadata Set Tab

Metadata Sets are groups of fields that can be added to Document Types.

Metadata Sets can be grouped in a hierarchy and can become the foundation of another metadata set (an "extension"). A "child" metadata set is displayed on the same level as the parent.

![The Metadata Set Tab contains all Metadata Sets.](./documents-and-media-ui-reference/images/03.png)

Click the (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) to create a new Metadata Set.

To learn more about Metadata Sets, see [Using Metadata Sets](./uploading-and-managing/managing-metadata/using-metadata-sets.md).

## Documents and Media Settings

You can access the application's settings from any of the three tabs by clicking the (![Options icon](../../images/icon-options.png)) to access the _Options_ menu.
