# Enabling Optimization of Animated Gifs

To scale animated GIFs, Adaptive Media uses an external tool called [Gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/). Otherwise, if Gifsicle isn't installed and `image/gif` is included as a supported MIME type, Adaptive Media scales only one frame of the GIF, making a static GIF.

Optimizing animated GIFs using Adaptive Media requires three steps: installing Gifsicle on your local server where DXP is running, setting the `PATH` environment variable, and then enabling Gifsicle in DXP's _System Settings_.

Once Gifsicle has been installed:

1. Navigate to the _Global Menu_ &rarr; _Control Panel_.
