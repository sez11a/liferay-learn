# Enabling Links to Google Drive Documents

You can create Document Library files that link to files in Google Drive&trade; and Google Photos&trade;. This lets you access your Google files from the Document Library. Note that this functionality isn't available by default. To enable it, you must complete these steps:

1. Install the Liferay Plugin for Google Drive&trade; from Liferay Marketplace.
1. Create and/or configure a Google project capable of communicating with your DXP instance. The [Google Picker API](https://developers.google.com/picker/) must be enabled for this project. This API lets you select Google files to link to. You must also create the credentials the Google project needs to communicate with your DXP instance.
1. Configure your portal to communicate with your Google project.

This article shows you how to complete these steps and finishes with an example of linking to a Google file from the Document Library.

```Important::
   The Liferay Plugin for Google Drive&trade; is a Labs application available for Liferay CE Portal and Liferay DXP. Labs apps are experimental and not supported by Liferay. They're released to accelerate the availability of useful and cutting-edge features. This status may change without notice. Use Labs apps at your own discretion.
```
