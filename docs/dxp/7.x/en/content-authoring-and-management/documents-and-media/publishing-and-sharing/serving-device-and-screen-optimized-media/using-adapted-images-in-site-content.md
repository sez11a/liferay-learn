# Using Adapted Images in Site Content

Adaptive Media works behinds the scenes so that when blog and web content creators upload an image for their content, the app automatically adapts the image. Adaptive Media identifies each adapted image in the content's HTML with a `data-fileentryid` attribute that is replaced with the latest adapted image when the user views the content. This lets Adaptive Media deliver the latest adapted images to your content, even if the content existed prior to those images.

```tip::
   If Adaptive Media is uninstalled, the original images are displayed in the blog entries and web content articles.
```

## Including Adapted Images in Content

When uploading images in a blog or web content, Adaptive Media works only with images added from the _Blog Images_, _Documents and Media_, and _Upload_ tabs. Additionally, adapted images can only be applied to a blog entry's content, not cover images. Adaptive Media works for images added to a blog entry via drag and drop, as the image is automatically uploaded to the Blog Images repository, adapted, and then included in the blog entry's content. You can see this by inspecting the HTML and checking that the image contains the `<img>` tag and `data-fileentryid` attribute.

For web content articles, Adaptive Media works only with images added from the file selector's _Documents and Media_ tab. Unlike blogs, Adaptive Media doesn't deliver adapted images for images added to web content articles via drag and drop.

For both blog entries and media content articles, Adaptive Media doesn't work with images added from the file selector's *URL* tab. This is because the image is linked directly from the URL and therefore provides no image file for Adaptive Media to copy.

Note that you can see the `<img>` tag and `data-fileentryid` attribute in the HTML of a blog entry or a web content article while you're writing it. When the content is displayed, the HTML is automatically replaced and looks similar to this:

```html
    <picture>

        <source media="(max-width:850px)" srcset="/o/adaptive-media/image/44147/med/photo.jpeg">

        <source media="(max-width:1200px) and (min-width:850px)" srcset="/o/adaptive-media/image/44147/hd/photo.jpeg">

        <source media="(max-width:2000px) and (min-width:1200px)" srcset="/o/adaptive-media/image/44147/ultra-hd/photo.jpeg">

        <img src="/documents/20140/0/photo.jpeg/1992-9143-85d2-f72ec1ff77a0">

    </picture>
```

This example uses three different images, each with a different resolution. A `source` tag defines each of these images. Also note the original image (`img`) is used as a fallback in case the adapted images aren't available.

## Using Adapted Images in Structured Web Content

To use adapted images in [structured web content](../../../web-content/user-guide/web-content-articles/adding-a-basic-web-content-article.md), <!--Need to update the URL for web content structures.--> content creators must manually include an image field in the web content's structure. Then they can reference that image field in the matching template by selecting it on the left side of the editor. Here's an example snippet of an image field named `Imagecrrf` included in a template:

```markup
    <#if Imagecrrf.getData()?? && Imagecrrf.getData() !="">
      <img data-fileentryid="${Imagecrrf.getAttribute("fileEntryId")}" alt="${Imagecrrf.getAttribute("alt")}" src="${Imagecrrf.getData()}" />
    </#if>
```

This snippet includes the `data-fileentryid` attribute to ensure that Adaptive Media replaces the image with an adapted image. If you inspect the resulting web content's HTML in the editor's code view, you should see a tag like this:

```html
    <img data-fileentryid="37308" src="/documents/20143/0/photo.jpeg/85140258-1c9d-89b8-4e45-d79d5e262318?t=1518425" />
```

Note the `<img>` tag with a `data-fileentryid` attribute. Adaptive Media uses the file entry ID to replace the `<img>` element automatically with a `<picture>` element that contains the available adapted images for each resolution (see the `<picture>` example above).

## Staging Adapted Images

Adaptive Media is fully integrated with DXP's [content staging](/dxp/7.x/en/content_authoring_and_management.html) and [export/import](../../../../site-building/building-sites/importing-exporting-pages-and-content.md) functionality. Adaptive Media includes adapted images in staged content when published, and can update those images to match any new resolutions.

Similarly, when content that contains adapted images is exported, Adaptive Media exports those images in the LAR file. That LAR file can then be imported to restore or transfer that content, along with its adapted images.

Adaptive Media doesn't regenerate adapted images during export/import or the publication of staged content. To improve performance, Adaptive Media instead reuses the existing adapted images.
