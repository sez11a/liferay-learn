# Assigning Template Permissions

Structures and templates provide direct access to Liferay's API. To avoid unauthorized or unintended access to Liferay DXP functionality, you should configure permissions for Templates so only trusted users can create or edit templates.

As a best practice, define two different roles with access to templates:

* Content Developers: Users under this role have permissions to create and edit Templates
* Content Creators: Users under this role have permission to view the templates, so they can use them to create content.

Consider the following information when you assign permissions to templates:

1. You can define the roles to have global permissions for all templates across the Liferay DXP instance, or only for specific sites.

To assign permissions for a template:
1. Go to Go to *Site Administrator* &rarr; *Content & Data* &rarr; *Web Content*.
2. Select the *Templates* tab.
3. For the template where you want to assign permissions, select the *Actions* button (![Actions](../../../../../../images/icon-actions.png)).
