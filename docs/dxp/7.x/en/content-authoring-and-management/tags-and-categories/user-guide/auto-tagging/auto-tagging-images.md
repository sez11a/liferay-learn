# Auto Tagging Images

Once [asset auto tagging has been enabled](./configuring-asset-auto-tagging.md), you can also enable image auto tagging. Image auto tagging automatically tags images uploaded to the Documents and Media Library.

```tip::
   Currently, tags applied automatically are English only.
```

By default, Image Auto Tagging is disabled by default. In addition to enabling Auto Tagging in DXP, users must also enable an image auto tagging provider. Three such providers are available:

* [**TensorFlow:**](#configuring-tensorflow-image-auto-tagging) An open-source library that provides machine learning capabilities. TensorFlow image auto-tagging in DXP is based on [TensorFlow's `LabelImage` sample for Java](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/examples/LabelImage.java), and uses the Inception5h model. Use this with caution, since its accuracy is limited.

* [**Google Cloud Vision:**](#configuring-google-cloud-vision) Uses the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) to automatically tag images.

* [**Microsoft Cognitive Services:**](#configuring-microsoft-cognitive-services) Uses [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) to automatically tag images.

## Configuring TensorFlow Image Auto Tagging

Follow the steps below:

1. Click the _Global Menu_ &rarr; _Control Panel_
1. Click _System Settings_.

    ![Navigate to the System Settings.](./auto-tagging-images/images/02.png)

1. Click _Assets_ under _Content and Data_.

    ![Click on Assets.](./auto-tagging-images/images/03.png)

1. Under _VIRTUAL INSTANCE SCOPE_, click _TensorFlow Image Auto Tagging_.
1. Enter the following information:

    * **Enable TensorFlow Image Auto Tagging:** Check this box to select whether image auto-tagging is enabled by default in any instance that has asset auto tagging enabled.

    * **Confidence Threshold:** TensorFlow assigns a confidence level between 0 and 1 for each tag, where 1 is the highest confidence and 0 is the lowest. This field sets the minimum confidence level that TensorFlow needs to apply a tag. Higher values yield fewer tags because TensorFlow needs more confidence before it applies a tag. Likewise, lower values yield more tags.

1. Click _Save_ when finished.

### Optimizing TensorFlow Auto Tagging Performance

Follow the steps below:

1. Click the _Global Menu_ &rarr; _Control Panel_
1. Click _System Settings_.
1. Click _Assets_.
1. Under _SYSTEM SCOPE_, click _TensorFlow Image Auto Tagging Process_.
1. Enter the following:

    * **Maximum Number of Relaunches:** The maximum number of times the process is allowed to crash before it is permanently disabled.

    * **Maximum Number of Relaunches Time Interval:** The time in seconds after which the counter is reset.

    ![You can fine tune the process that runs the TensorFlow image auto tagging in the portal.](./auto-tagging-images/images/05.png)

1. Click _Save to apply the settings.

The TensorFlow provider has been configured.

## Configuring Google Cloud Vision

Follow the steps below:

1. Click the _Global Menu_ &rarr; _Control Panel_
1. Click _System Settings_.
1. Click _Assets_.
1. Under _VIRTUAL INSTANCE SCOPE_, click _Google Cloud Vision Image Auto Tagging_.
1. Enter your Google Cloud Vision API Key. For more information, see [Google's documentation on API keys](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys).
1. Check the _Enabled_ box to enable Google Cloud Vision.

    ![The Google Cloud Vision provider requires an API key.](./auto-tagging-images/images/06.png)

1. Click _Save_ when finished.

## Configuring Microsoft Cognitive Services

Follow these steps:

1. Click the _Global Menu_ &rarr; _Control Panel_
1. Click _System Settings_.
1. Click _Assets_
1. Under _VIRTUAL INSTANCE SCOPE_, click _Microsoft Cognitive Services Image Auto Tagging_.
1. Enter the following information:

    * **API Key:** Your [API key](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/my-apis/?apiSlug=computer-services) for the Computer Vision API V2.

    * **API Endpoint:** The endpoint for the Computer Vision API V2 (`https://westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v2.0`).

1. Check the _Enabled_ box.

    ![The Microsoft Cognitive Services provider requires an API key and an endpoint.](./auto-tagging-images/images/07.png)

1. Click _Save_ when finished.

The Microsoft Cognitive Services provider has been configured. For more information, see the [Microsoft Cognitive Services documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/).

If you have more than one virtual instance, you can configure each instance individually. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Instance Settings_. Click _Assets_ then configure the provider there.
