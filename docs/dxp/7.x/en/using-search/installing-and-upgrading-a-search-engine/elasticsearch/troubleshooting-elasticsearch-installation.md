# Troubleshooting Elasticsearch Installation

If you've set up [Liferay DXP with Elasticsearch](./getting-started-with-elasticsearch.md) in remote mode, but Liferay DXP can't connect to Elasticsearch, check these things:

## Cluster Name

The value of the `cluster.name` property in `elasticsearch.yml` must match the `clusterName` property configured in the Liferay DXP Elasticsearch connector.

## Transport Addresses

The value of the `transportAddresses` property in the Elasticsearch connector configuration must contain at least one valid host and port where an Elasticsearch node is running. If Liferay DXP is running in embedded mode, and you start a standalone Elasticsearch node or cluster, it detects that port `9300` is taken and switches to port `9301`. If you then set Liferay's Elasticsearch connector to remote mode, it continues to look for Elasticsearch at the default port (`9300`). Be sure to list all master and data node addresses of the cluster.

The following articles cover the Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch's configuration options in more detail.

## Network Host Addresses

In Liferay CE/DXP 7.3, the bundled Elasticsearch server (Sidecar) runs on port `9201` by default. This means that setting the `networkHostAddress` of your remote Elasticsearch installation using Elasticsearch's default HTTP port (`9200`) will not cause a conflict. As with the transport addresses, be sure to list all master and data node addresses of the cluster.

## Cluster Sniffing (Additional Configurations)

Elasticsearch clusters can have multiple node [types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/modules-node.html#modules-node).  [Cluster sniffing](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-api/7.x/transport-client.html), enabled by default in the Liferay DXP connector, looks for `data` nodes configured in the `transportAddresses` property. If none are available, the connector may throw a `NoNodeAvailableException` in the console log. If cluster sniffing is to remain enabled, be sure that your configuration allows for at least one `data` node's transport address to be "sniffable" at all times to avoid this error.

To disable cluster sniffing, add `clientTransportSniff=false` to the `.config` file or un-check the Client Transport Sniff property in System Settings.

## [Docker] Connection Refused

The Liferay DXP container must recognize the Elasticsearch IP to establish a connection. Add `/etc/hosts/` entries that map the Elasticsearch container name to the Elasticsearch server host IP address. This can be established during the `docker run` phase by passing an argument like this:

```bash
--add-host elasticsearch:[IP address]
```

To obtain the IP addresses of all running containers, run 

```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```

## Configuration File Names

If you are experiencing any problem connecting Liferay CE/DXP to Elasticsearch (perhaps seeing `NoNodeAvailableException` messages in the Liferay CE/DXP log), one of the first steps to take is to make absolutely sure that the configuration files are named properly. A Misnamed configuration file cannot have its values read by the system and the resultant errors can vary.
