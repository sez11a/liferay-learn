Elasticsearch
=============

Elasticsearch, a highly scalable, full-text search engine, is the default search engine used by Liferay DXP. Elasticsearch is well-supported and almost certainly meets any search and indexing need you have, but you must not use the `built-in version in your production deployment <./elasticsearch/using-the-built-in-elasticsearch.md>`__. 

.. important::
   Always consult the `compatibility matrix <https://www.liferay.com/documents/10182/246659966/Liferay+DXP+7.2+Compatibility+Matrix.pdf/ed234765-db47-c4ad-7c82-2acb4c73b0f9>`__ to learn which versions of Elasticsearch are supported for your version of Liferay DXP.
