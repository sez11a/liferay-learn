Elasticsearch
=============

Elasticsearch, a highly scalable, full-text search engine, is the default search engine used by Liferay DXP. Elasticsearch almost certainly meets any search and indexing need you have, but you must not use the `built-in version in your production deployment <./elasticsearch/using-the-built-in-elasticsearch.md>`__. 

.. important::
   Always consult the `compatibility matrix <https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/sections/360002103292-Compatibility-Matrix>`__ to learn which versions of Elasticsearch are supported for your version of Liferay DXP.
