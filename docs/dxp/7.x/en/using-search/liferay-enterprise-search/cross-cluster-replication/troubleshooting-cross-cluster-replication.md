# Troubleshooting Cross-Cluster Replication

Known common pitfalls encountered during the CCR setup are covered here. For further troubleshooting, look at [Elastic's forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/tag/cross-cluster-replication).

## Exceptions During Reindex: `RetentionLeaseNotFoundException` and `IndexNotFoundException`

When a reindex is triggered on the Leader DXP node, the Follower Elasticsearch node may throw errors like this:

```bash
[2020-05-25T14:49:21,478][WARN ][o.e.x.c.a.ShardFollowNodeTask] [es-follower-node-1] shard follow task encounter non-retryable error
org.elasticsearch.transport.RemoteTransportException: [es-leader-node-1][127.0.0.1:9300][indices:data/read/xpack/ccr/shard_changes]
Caused by: org.elasticsearch.index.IndexNotFoundException: no such index
  at org.elasticsearch.cluster.routing.RoutingTable.shardRoutingTable(RoutingTable.java:119) ~[elasticsearch-6.8.6.jar:6.8.6]
```

and this:
```bash
[2020-05-25T14:49:50,750][WARN ][o.e.x.c.a.ShardFollowTasksExecutor] [es-follower-node-1] [liferay-20101][0] background management of retention lease [LiferayElasticsearchCluster_FOLLOWER/liferay-20101/3a22HGCGS9iDl5rCbutNHg-following-leader/liferay-20101/lZThZJuhTLSaNYTSxmeX8A] failed while following

```

From <https://www.elastic.co/blog/follow-the-leader-an-introduction-to-cross-cluster-replication-in-elasticsearch>:

> With a shard history retention lease, a follower can mark in the history of operations on the leader where in history that follower currently is. The leader shards know that operations below that marker are safe to be merged away, but any operations above that marker must be retained for until the follower has had the opportunity to replicate them. These markers ensure that if a follower goes offline temporarily, the leader will retain operations that have not yet been replicated. Since retaining this history requires additional storage on the leader, these markers are only valid for a limited period after which the marker will expire and the leader shards will be free to merge away history. You can tune the length of this period based on how much additional storage you are willing to retain in case a follower goes offline, and how long youâ€™re willing to accept a follower being offline before it would otherwise have to be re-bootstrapped from the leader.
