# Configuring CCR in a Local Follower Data Center

> Go through the [configuring CCR In a Remote Leader Data Center](./configuring-ccr-in-a-remote-leader-data-center.md) article before following the steps below.

This data center holds Liferay DXP cluster nodes with a read-only connection to the co-located Elasticsearch cluster, and a write-only connection to the remote/leader data center's Elasticsearch cluster.

### Configure the Local Elasticsearch Cluster 

The local Elasticsearch cluster must hold follower (replicated; read-only) indexes, and acts as the local search engine co-located Liferay DXP nodes can read from.

Configure its `elasticsearch.yml`, specifying a `http.port` and `transport.port` that won't collide with the other Elasticsearch server:

`Elasticsearch/HOME/config/elasticsearch.yml`

```yaml
cluster.name: LiferayElasticsearchCluster_FOLLOWER
http.port: 9201
node.name: es-follower-node-1
transport.port: 9301
```

Start the server. If you're in the root of the server directory, execute

```bash
./bin/elasticssearch
```

If you're just trying this out and don't yet have the proper license, start an Elasticsearch trial:

```json
POST /_license/start_trial?acknowledge=true
```

> On Elasticsearch 6, use
> 
> `POST _xpack/license/start_trial?acknowledge=true`

## Replicate the Leader Indexes

If you're configuring a new installation with CCR, you can [auto-follow](#configuring-auto-follow) the leader's indexes from the local/follower Elasticsearch cluster. Otherwise, [manually replicate](#manually-replicating-the-leader-indexes) the leader's indexes.

```note::
   Company indexes (`liferay-0` and `liferay-<companyId>`) are re-followed automatically when a **reindex** is performed in DXP. Since the Search Tuning and Workflow Metrics indexes will not be dropped and re-created by a full reindex action the "auto-follow" pattern can be deleted after your initial installation is done.
```

> It is on our roadmap to make it easier for Search admins to setup follower indexes in a future version of the CCR Module. See [LPS-109204](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LPS-109204).

### Configuring Auto-Follow

> Only Possible with New Installations

If your new Liferay DXP/Elasticsearch Cross-Cluster Replication installation is likely to add indexes over time, or you just want to avoid manually replicating all the Liferay DXP indexes, you can leverage the auto-follow functionality of Elasticsearch.

> Refer to Elastic's auto-follow documentation: <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/ccr-auto-follow.html>

Here's the overview:

1. Configure and start the leader and follower Elasticsearch nodes.
1. Connect Kibana to the follower Elasticsearch node.
1. In Kibana, go to Management &rarr; Remote Clusters and add a new remote cluster: "leader, 127.0.0.1:9300"

    ```json
    PUT _cluster/settings
    {
      "persistent": {
        "cluster": {
          "remote": {
            "leader": {
              "seeds": [
                "127.0.0.1:9300"
              ],
              "skip_unavailable": false
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. In Kibana, go to Management &rarr; Cross Cluster Replication &rarr; Auto-follow patterns tab:

    Name: `liferay-follow-patterns`
    Remote cluster: `leader`
    Leader patterns: `liferay-*, workflow-*`


    Or use the `auto_follow` api endpoint:
    ```json
    PUT /_ccr/auto_follow/liferay-follow-patterns
    {
      "remote_cluster": "leader",
      "leader_index_patterns": [
        "liferay-*",
        "workflow-*"
      ],
      "follow_index_pattern": "{{leader_index}}"
    }
    ```

1. Start the Leader Liferay DXP Cluster Node and wait until it is up and running. The indexes matching the provided pattern automatically replicate into the local/follower Elasticsearch cluster. 

1. Verify in Kibana that the follower indexes have been created: in Management &rarr; Cross Cluster Replication &rarr; Follower indexes tab, you should see all matching indexes listed.

```tip::
   The auto-follow functionality also comes in handy when you add a new Virtual Instance in Liferay DXP which creates a new company index in the Leader Elasticsearch cluster. As long as it matches the auto-follow pattern, replication occurs automatically.
```

### Manually Replicating the Leader Indexes

The replication of indexes in CCR is a _pull_ type operation: it's executed from the local cluster holding the follower indexes. First you'll need to configure the leader/follower relationship between the clusters, then perform the replication on each index.

```tip::
   Restart Kibana after reconfiguring the ``kibana.yml`` to connect to your local/follower Elasticsearch cluster:

``elasticsearch.hosts: [ "http://localhost:9201" ]``

```

Two Elasticsearch API endpoints are called from the local Elasticsearch cluster: `_cluster/settings` and `_ccr/follow`.

First set the leader cluster:

```json
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    "cluster" : {
      "remote" : {
        "leader" : {
          "seeds" : [
            "127.0.0.1:9300" 
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This can also be done from Kibana &rarr; Management &rarr; Remote Clusters: click on the _Add a remote cluster_ button and fill out the form.

![Add a remote cluster in Kibana 7.](./configuring-ccr-in-a-local-follower-data-center/images/ccr-add-remote-cluster-kibana-7_follower-cluster.png)

Messages including `updating [cluster.remote.leader.seeds]` are printed in the log:

```bash
[2020-05-21T13:22:00,256][INFO ][o.e.c.s.ClusterSettings  ] [es-follower-node-1] updating [cluster.remote.leader.seeds] from [[]] to [["127.0.0.1:9300"]]
[2020-05-21T13:22:00,259][INFO ][o.e.c.s.ClusterSettings  ] [es-follower-node-1] updating [cluster.remote.leader.seeds] from [[]] to [["127.0.0.1:9300"]]

```

Once the leader is configured, use the Follow API to perform the initial index replication of the leader's indexes into the local/follower cluster:

```json
PUT /liferay-20101/_ccr/follow?wait_for_active_shards=1
{
  "remote_cluster" : "leader",
  "leader_index" : "liferay-20101"
}
```

This can also be done through Kibana &rarr; Management &rarr; Cross Cluster Replication: click on the _Create a follower index_ button and fill out the form.

![Add a follower index in Kibana 7.](./configuring-ccr-in-a-local-follower-data-center/images/ccr-add-follower-index-kibana-7_follower-cluster.png)

```note::
   The value ``leader`` is used in the API calls above, as it is the default `alias to the remote cluster <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.x/ccr-getting-started.html#ccr-getting-started-remote-cluster>`_: if you use a different alias, change this value in the API calls, and set the same value in the ``remoteClusterAlias`` property of the ``CrossClusterReplicationConfiguration``.
```

Messages indicating that the shard has started and that the leader is being tracked will appear in the console:

```bash
[2020-05-21T13:31:29,888][INFO ][o.e.c.r.a.AllocationService] [es-follower-node-1] Cluster health status changed from [YELLOW] to [GREEN] (reason: [shards started [[liferay-20101][0]] ...]).

```

Repeat the above PUT call for all the indexes you see listed at Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr; Search &rarr; Field Mappings. For example, these indexes are present in most systems:

- liferay-0
- liferay-20101
- liferay-search-tuning-rankings
- liferay-search-tuning-synonyms-liferay-20101
- workflow-metrics-instances
- workflow-metrics-nodes
- workflow-metrics-processes
- workflow-metrics-sla-instance-results
- workflow-metrics-sla-task-results
- workflow-metrics-tokens

> Checkpoint---Navigate to Management &rarr; Cross Cluster Replication in Kibana and you see something like this:

![Verify that the follower indexes are present in Kibana 7.](./configuring-ccr-in-a-local-follower-data-center/images/ccr-follower-indexes-configured-kibana-7_follower-cluster.png)

Now the local/follower Elasticsearch cluster knows how to replicate from the remote/leader Elasticsearch cluster. The last step is to wire up the local Liferay DXP cluster node so it reads from this local Elasticsearch cluster's follower indexes, and writes to the remote/leader Elasticsearch cluster.

### Configure the Local Liferay DXP Cluster Node

Configure Tomcat to use different ports than your remote DXP node. We use `9080` as the HTTP port in this example setup.

Provide a `portal-ext.properties` file with these contents:

```properties
cluster.link.enabled=true
```

Then configure the Liferay Connector to Elasticsearch X [6 or 7] by providing a configuration file in the `Liferay Home/osgi/configs` folder. If using Elasticsearch 7, name it

```bash
com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch7.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config
```

If using Elasticsearch 6, the configuration file is named

```bash
com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch6.configuration.ElasticsearchConfiguration.config
```

This file configures the write-enabled connection to the remote Elasticsearch cluster with the leader indexes. Give it these contents:

```properties
clusterName = "LiferayElasticsearchCluster_LEADER"
operationMode = "REMOTE"
transportAddresses = ["localhost:9300"]
```

Now configure the read-only connection to the local Elasticsearch server with the follower indexes. Provide a configuration file named 

```bash
com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.cross.cluster.replication.internal.configuration.ElasticsearchConnectionConfiguration-follower.config
```

Give it these contents:

```properties
connectionId = "follower"
clusterName = "LiferayElasticsearchCluster_FOLLOWER"
networkHostAddress = "http://localhost:9201"
transportAddresses = ["localhost:9301"]

#networkHostAddress = "https://localhost:9201"
#authenticationEnabled = B"true"
#username = "elastic"
#password = "liferay"
#certificateFormat = "PEM"
#sslKeyPath = "/PATH/TO/elastic-certificates.key"
#sslCertificatePath = "/PATH/TO/elastic-certificates.crt"
#sslCertificateAuthoritiesPaths = "/PATH/TO/ca.crt"
#transportSSLVerificationMode = "certificate"
#transportSSLEnabled = B"true"
```

You can use any suffix (`-follower` in this example) for the configuration file name, but for consistency you should make it identical to the `connectionId` property in the configuration.

```note::
   **To enable security**, uncomment the properties in the above configuration, update the settings to match your environment and remove the other ```networkHostAddress = "http://localhost:9201"``` property (or change it to use ```https```). We assume you went through the [prerequisites](./configuring-ccr-a-basic-use-case.md#prerequisite-for-security-configure-x-pack-security) to configure X-Pack Security.
```

The connection is configured. Next enable CCR by providing a configuration file named

```bash
com.liferay.portal.search.elasticsearch.cross.cluster.replication.internal.configuration.CrossClusterReplicationConfiguration.config
```

Give it the following contents:

```properties
ccrEnabled = B"true"
ccrLocalClusterConnectionConfigurations = ["localhost:9080=follower"]
remoteClusterAlias = "leader"
```

```note::
   The local/follower DXP node used ``9080`` as its HTTP port. If you have a different port, adjust the portal address in ``ccrLocalClusterConnectionConfigurations`` accordingly.
```

Now start the local Liferay DXP Cluster node.

## Verify the Setup

On the follower DXP cluster node, navigate to Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr; Search and select the _Connections_ tab. Your connections look like this:

![Verify the Elasticsearch 7 connections in the Search administration panel.](./configuring-ccr-in-a-local-follower-data-center/images/ccr-verify-setup-elasticsearch-7-connections-on-the-follower-dxp-cluster-node.png)

```note::
   The Connections tab only appears in the Search admin if the CCR module is installed and running. Therefore, it's only available in the local Liferay DXP nodes.
```

If you are using Elasticsearch 6, the Connections page looks a little different:

![Verifying the Elasticsearch 6 connections in the Search administration panel.](./configuring-ccr-in-a-local-follower-data-center/images/ccr-verify-setup-elasticsearch-6-connections-on-the-follower-dxp-cluster-node.png)

> Don't forget to delete the "auto-follow" pattern from the Follower Elasticsearch cluster otherwise you may experience exceptions reporting when performing a reindex.

You can get an overview about the example configurations [here](./ccr-basic-use-case-config-reference.md).
