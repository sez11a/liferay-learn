## Social Tools

The following social applications are included with Liferay DXP:

* Activities

## Invitations

The _Invite Members_ widget lets Site Administrators send invitations to join the Site. When Users confirm such invitations, they become Site members assigned to the Roles defined by the site administrator. Click to learn more about [Site Membership](../site-building/building-sites/adding-members-to-sites.md).
