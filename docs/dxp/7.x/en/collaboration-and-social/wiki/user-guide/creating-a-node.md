# Creating a Node

As more wiki pages are created in a single DXP site, creating additional wiki nodes can provide a loose structure to organize your wiki pages accordingly. Users can create a nodes to segment articles that cover different topics.

Only authenticated users with the [requisite permissions](./wiki-permissions.md) (at minimum, _Add Node_ and _Permissions_) can create a node. To learn more about DXP Roles and Permissions in general, see [Roles and Permissions](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360017895212-Roles-and-Permissions).

## Creating a New Node

1. Navigate to the site where the wiki is located (for example, _Liferay DXP_).
1. Expand the _Product Menu)_ and then the _Site Administration_ menu.
1. Click _Content & Data_ &rarr; _Wiki_.
1. Click the _Add Wiki_ (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) button.
1. Enter the following:
    * **Name**: New Node
    * **Description**: This is a new node for DXP Guest wiki site.
1. Click _Save_.

A new Node has been created. You can create multiple nodes on the same site.
