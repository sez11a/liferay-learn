Sites are a fundamental component of Liferay DXP. At its core, a Site is a collection of pages that contains content. However, a Site can also contain applications that provide additional functionality for the page---many are available for you to use out-of-the-box. Liferay DXP includes powerful features that you can harness to streamline the Site creation process and create rich and personalized experiences for users. To learn more about Site Building with Liferay read the `Introduction to Site Building <./site-building/introduction-to-site-building.md>`_.
