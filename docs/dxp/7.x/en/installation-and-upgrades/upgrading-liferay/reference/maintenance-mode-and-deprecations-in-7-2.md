# Maintenance Mode and Deprecations in 7.2

With each new DXP release, a feature may not warrant continued enhancements or may become obsolete. Stopping enhancements for a feature puts it in *Maintenance Mode*. Obsolete features are *Deprecated*.

There are three types of deprecated apps:

1.  Deprecated apps that remain in Liferay, but will be removed in a future release. (Availability: *Bundled*)

2.  Deprecated apps that have been removed from Liferay, yet are still available for download via [Liferay Marketplace](https://web.liferay.com/marketplace) (Availability:
    *Marketplace*)

3.  Deprecated apps that have been removed from Liferay and aren't available for download. (Availability: *Removed*)

```note::
   All apps deprecated by Liferay are no longer in active development. You should therefore plan to stop using these apps.
```

If you're upgrading from Liferay 7.0 or earlier, examine the deprecations that occurred in the applicable releases:
