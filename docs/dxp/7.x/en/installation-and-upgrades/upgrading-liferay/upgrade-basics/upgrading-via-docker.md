# Upgrading Via Docker

Running a Liferay Docker image with auto-upgrade enabled upgrades your database on Liferay startup. After the upgrade completes, you can continue [using Liferay via that Docker container](../../../installation-and-upgrades/installing-liferay/using-liferay-dxp-docker-images/dxp-docker-container-basics.md) or point a new Liferay on-premises installation to the upgraded database.

```important::
   Don't have Docker? Go here first: `Linux <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/>`_ | `Windows <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/>`_ | `OSX <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/>`_

   Upgrades to enterprise subscriber installations and critical installations should be done using the Database Upgrade Tool. See `Using the Database Upgrade Tool <./using-the-database-upgrade-tool.md>`_ for more information.
```

```important::
   **Always** `back up <../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/backing-up.md>`_ your database and existing installation before upgrading. Testing the upgrade process on backup copies is advised.
```

## Upgrading with the Latest Docker Image

Here are the steps for upgrading with a Docker image:

1. Create an arbitrary folder to use with the new Liferay Docker image and create subfolders called `files` and `deploy`. For example,

    ```
    mkdir -p new-version/files
    ```

    ```
    mkdir -p new-version/deploy
    ```

    * `files`: The Docker container copies files from this folder to the container's [Liferay Home](../../reference/liferay-home.md) folder.

    * `deploy`: The Docker container copies artifacts from this folder to the container's auto-deploy folder.

1. If you're using an embedded [Elasticsearch](../../../using-search/installing-and-upgrading-a-search-engine/introduction-to-installing-a-search-engine.md) engine or a local [File Store \(Document Library\)](../../../system-administration/file-storage/configuring-file-storage.md), copy the `[Liferay Home]/data` folder from your [backup](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/backing-up.md) to the `files` folder (e.g., creating `new-version/files/data`).

1. Copy and merge the [Liferay Home files](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/backing-up.md#liferay-home) and [application server files](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/backing-up.md#application-server) from your backup to their corresponding locations in the `files` folder (your new `[Liferay Home]`). For example, copy your activation key from `[Liferay Home backup]/license/` to `new-version/files/license/`. The files may include but are not limited to these:

    * `/license/*`: Activation keys. (Subscription)

    * `/log/*`: Log files.

    * `/osgi/*.config`: OSGi configuration files.

    * `portal-*.properties`: Portal properties files, such as `portal-ext.properties`.

    * `setenv.sh`, `startup.sh`, and more: Application server configuration scripts.

    * `web.xml`: Portal web application descriptor.

1. Make sure you're using the JDBC database driver your database vendor recommends. If you're using MySQL, for example, set `jdbc.default.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver` in [`new-version/files/portal-ext.properties`](../../reference/portal-properties.md) and replace the MySQL JDBC driver JAR your app server uses. See [Database Drivers](../configuration-and-infrastructure/migrating-configurations-and-properties.md#database-drivers) for more details.

1. Run the Docker image [mounted](../../installing-liferay/using-liferay-dxp-docker-images/providing-files-to-the-container.md) to your new version folder using the following command. Substitute the image name, tag, and environment values as needed.

    ```bash
    docker run -it -p 8080:8080 \
     -v $(pwd)/new-version:/mnt/liferay \
     -e LIFERAY_UPGRADE_PERIOD_DATABASE_PERIOD_AUTO_PERIOD_RUN=true \
     liferay/[place image name here]:[place tag here]
    ```

    The `-v new-version:/mnt/liferay` arguments bind mount the host's `new-version` folder to the container's `/mnt/liferay` folder. Please see [Providing Files to the Container](../../installing-liferay/using-liferay-dxp-docker-images/providing-files-to-the-container.md) for more information on the mapping files to the container's Liferay Home.

    The parameter `-e LIFERAY_UPGRADE_PERIOD_DATABASE_PERIOD_AUTO_PERIOD_RUN=true` triggers the database upgrade.

1. In the console or log, confirm successful database upgrade and server startup. Upgrade messages report starting and completing each upgrade process. A message like this one indicates server startup completion:

    ```bash
    org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in [x] milliseconds
    ```

    If there are any upgrade failures or errors, they're printed to the console and log. You can use [Gogo Shell commands](../upgrade-stability-and-performance/upgrading-modules-using-gogo-shell.md) to troubleshoot any issues and finish the upgrade.

1. After you have resolved any failures or errors, examine the [Post Upgrade Considerations](./post-upgrade-considerations.md).

1. [Update the Portal properties](../configuration-and-infrastructure/migrating-configurations-and-properties.md#migrating-portal-properties) in your new installation.

1. Validate your upgraded database.

Your database upgrade is now complete!

If you want to continue using the new Liferay version via Docker, leave off the ``-e LIFERAY_UPGRADE_PERIOD_DATABASE_PERIOD_AUTO_PERIOD_RUN=true`` environment setting from the ``docker run ...`` command you use to create the new container.

```note::
   `Docker Container Basics <../../../installation-and-upgrades/installing-liferay/using-liferay-dxp-docker-images/dxp-docker-container-basics.md>`_ demonstrates creating, stopping, and restarting Docker containers.
