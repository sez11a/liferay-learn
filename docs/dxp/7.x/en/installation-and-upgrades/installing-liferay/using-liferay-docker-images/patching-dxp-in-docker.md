# Patching DXP in Docker

Liferay [patches](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/patching-liferay.md) fix DXP issues and the Patching Tool applies the patches. On [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/dxp), Liferay provides images pre-populated with each new [Fix Pack](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/patching-liferay.md#fix-packs), [Security Fix Pack](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/patching-liferay.md#scurity-fix-packs), and [Service Pack](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/patching-liferay.md#service-packs). Liferay also provides [Security Fix Packs](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/patching-liferay.md#scurity-fix-packs), [Hotfixes](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/patching-liferay.md#hotfixes), and new [Patching Tool](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/installing-the-patching-tool.md) versions to install to DXP containers.

## Using Fix Pack, Security Fix Pack, and Service Pack Images

Fix Pack, Security Fix Pack, and Service Pack images are based on [Slim Bundles](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/advanced-patching-for-dxp-7-2/using-slim-bundles.md). Slim Bundles start up faster and have a smaller footprint than regular [Liferay Tomcat bundles](../installing-a-liferay-tomcat-bundle.md). Only one patch, however, can be applied to a Slim Bundle. These images, therefore, have these patching limitations:

* Fix Pack and Service Pack images can receive only one additional patch, such as a Hotfix or a Security Fix Pack.

* Security Fix Pack images cannot be patched. They comprise a Fix Pack patched with a Security Fix Pack already.

Using a new Fix Pack, Security Fix Pack, or Service Pack image requires migrating to a container based on that image. Here is how to migrate from a DXP container to a new patch image.

1. [Stop your current DXP container](./docker-container-basics.md#stopping-a-container).

1. [Back up](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/backing-up.md) files you've used to customize your DXP container.

    ```bash
    git commit -a
    ```

1. Download the new image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/liferay/dxp).

    ```bash
    docker pull liferay/dxp:[tag]
    ```

1. Create a new container based on the image and that uses the artifacts and configuration files from your backup.

   For example, you can put your artifacts and files in a local folder structure like this:

    ```
    [host folder]
    ├───deploy
    ├───files
    ├───patching
    └───scripts
    ```

    Then [bind mount the host folder to the container's `/mnt/liferay` folder](./providing-files-to-the-container.md#bind-mounting-a-host-folder-to-mnt-liferay) in your `run` command.

    ```bash
    docker run ... -v [host folder path]:/mnt/liferay liferay/dxp:[tag]
    ```

DXP launches in the new container using your artifacts and files.

## Installing a Patch

Fix Pack images and Service Pack images are limited to receiving one additional patch. The patch can be a Hotfix, Security Fix Pack, or a patch that combines both. To get this last type of patch, create a [Help Center ticket](https://help.liferay.com/hc) and request a patch that includes the latest security fixes and product fixes on top of your current Fix Pack level.

Patching requirements:

1. No existing patches in the container. Any existing patch must be [reverted](#reverting-a-patch) before applying a new patch.

1. The image must not be Security Fix Pack image; those images already include a patch (the Security Fix Pack).

1. A folder in your volume or bind mount that maps to the container's `/mnt/liferay/patching` folder. Please see [Providing Files to the Container](./providing-files-to-the-container.md) for more information.

There are two methods for installing patches to containers:

1. [Installing a patch to an existing container](#installing-to-an-existing-container).

1. [Installing a patch to a new container](#installing-to-a-new-container).

### Installing to an Existing Container

Here are the steps for installing a patch to your existing container:

1. [Stop your current container](./docker-container-basics.md#stopping-a-container).

1. [Download](https://customer.liferay.com/downloads) the patch and copy it to a folder in a volume or [bind mount](./providing-files-to-the-container.md) that maps to the container's `/mnt/liferay/patching` folder.

1. [Restart your container](./docker-container-basics.md#restartings-a-container).

### Installing to a New Container

Here are steps for installing a patch to a new container:

1. Create a host folder and a subfolder called `patching`.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p [host folder]/patching
    ```

1. [Download](https://customer.liferay.com/downloads) the patch and copy it to your `[host folder]/patching` folder. For example,

   ```bash
   cp ~/[patch file] [host folder]/patching
   ```

1. [Stop your current DXP container](./docker-container-basics.md#stopping-a-container), if it's running.

1. Create a container with a bind mount that maps the patch file's folder to the container's `/mnt/liferay/patching` folder. Since this example's patch file is in a folder called `patching`, you can [bind mount](./providing-files-to-the-container.md#bind-mounting-a-host-folder-to-mnt-liferay) its parent folder (`[host folder]`) to the container's `/mnt/liferay` folder. This makes the patch accessible for applying to DXP.

    ```bash
    docker run ... -v [host folder path]:/mnt/liferay liferay/dxp:[tag]
    ```

    ```note::
       Please see `Providing Files to the Container <./providing-files-to-the-container.md>`_ for more information on specifying bind mounts.
    ```

The Patching Tool installs the patch and DXP launches.

```important::
   If the Patching Tool reports this message: ``[patch file] is incompatible with Patching Tool version [x.y.z]``, install the latest Patching Tool. See `Installing the Patching Tool <#installing-the-patching-tool>`_ for details.
```

## Reverting a Patch

If you want to revert a patch from a container or install a different patch to a patched container, you must remove the container and create a new one.

1. [Stop the container](./docker-container-basics.md#stopping-a-container).

    ```bash
    docker stop [container]
    ```

1. [Back up](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/backing-up.md) the container's artifacts and files.

1. Remove the container.

    ```bash
    docker rm [container]
    ```

1. Use the `docker run` arguments you used previously to create a new container from the same image or an image that has a compatible Fix Pack Level. Apply any patch you want via a volume or [bind mount](./providing-files-to-the-container.md#bind-mounting-a-host-folder-to-mnt-liferay).

## Updating the Patching Tool

If your current Patching Tool is incompatible with the patch you're installing, the Patching Tool reports this message: `[patch file] is incompatible with Patching Tool version [x.y.z]`, where `x.y.z` are the tool's major, minor, and micro version number.

Here's how to install a new [Patching Tool](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/installing-the-patching-tool.md) version:

1. Download the latest Patching Tool from the [Customer Portal](https://customer.liferay.com/downloads?p_p_id=com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_productAssetCategoryId=118191019&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_fileTypeAssetCategoryId=118191066).

1. If the Patching Tool ZIP file name doesn't have this format `patching-tool-x.y.z.zip` rename it to use that format. For example,

    ```bash
    mv patching-tool.zip patching-tool-2.0.15.zip
    ```

1. Install the Patching Tool ZIP file to the container via the container's `/mnt/liferay/patching` folder, in the same way that [Hotfixes and Security Fix Packs are installed](#installing-a-hotfix-or-security-fix-pack).

On restarting your container or running a new container, the container entry point installs the new Patching Tool.

## Upgrading the Database for a Patch

If a patch requires upgrading the database, you must upgrade it using the Database Upgrade Tool in a non-containerized environment.

1. Install the [Liferay Tomcat Bundle installation](../installing-a-liferay-tomcat-bundle.md) of the Liferay version you're using.

1. Apply the patch to the installation. Please see [Patching Liferay](../../maintaining-a-liferay-dxp-installation/patching-liferay/patching-liferay.md) for more information.

1. Upgrade the database using the Database Upgrade Tool. Please see [Using the Database Upgrade Tool](../../upgrading-liferay/upgrade-basics/using-the-database-upgrade-tool.md) for more information.

After the database is upgraded, run your container that uses that database.
