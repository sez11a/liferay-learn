# Command Line Gogo Shell

If you're in a development environment, you can interact with the module framework locally from the command line.

```warning::
   Gogo shell should only be run from the command line in development environments. In production environments, run Gogo shell in the Control Panel, as demonstrated in `Using the Gogo Shell <./using-the-gogo-shell.md>`_ .
```

## Prerequisites

Gogo shell on the command line requires that the server is running in Developer Mode. You can enable Developer Mode on the server in [Developer Studio](../../../developing-applications/tooling/developer-studio.md) or by setting the following [Portal Property](../../../installation-and-upgrades/reference/portal-properties.md):

```properties
include-and-override=portal-developer.properties
```

## Executing Commands

You can execute Gogo shell commands using [Blade CLI](../../../developing-applications/tooling/blade-cli/installing-and-updating-blade-cli.md) or a telnet session.

### Using Blade CLI

You can execute individual commands using Blade CLI:

```bash
blade sh [Gogo shell command]
blade sh [another Gogo shell command]
...
```

### Using a Telnet Session

You can execute commands in a `telnet` session:

1. Open a session:

    ```bash
    telnet localhost 11311
    ```

1. Execute Gogo shell commands.

1. When you're done executing commands, execute the `disconnect` command to end the session.

```warning::
   DO NOT execute the following commands. They stop the module framework.

   ``close``

   ``exit``

   ``shutdown``
 ```
