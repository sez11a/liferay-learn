# Introduction to the Workflow Designer

> Subscribers

The Workflow Designer is an intuitive interface that lets you design workflow definitions so your assets go through a review process before publication. With the Workflow Designer, you develop workflow definitions using a convenient drag and drop user interface. You do not need to be familiar with writing XML definitions by hand. Some of the features can be enhanced with Groovy scripts, a supported Java-based scripting language.

```tip::
   By default, only one workflow definition is installed: the Single Approver Workflow definition.
```

## Building Workflows

The Workflow Designer also lets you directly manipulate the XML (using the _Source) tab). See [Managing Workflows](./managing-workflows.md) to learn more.
