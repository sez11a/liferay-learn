1. Click _Content & Data_  &rarr; _Forms_.
1. Click the _Add_ button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)). The form builder view appears.
1. Click the _Add_ button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) one more time to display the _Add Elements_ sidebar (if it is not already opened).

## Field Configuration Overview

The field configuration editor sidebar appears whenever you add a new field or click an existing one in the form builder. The available configuration options differ by field type.

All Form Fields have at least two configuration types: basic and advanced. Many forms can be [created](../creating-and-managing-forms/creating-forms.md) with just the basic configurations, which include things like its label, [placeholder text, help text](../creating-and-managing-forms/providing-help-text-and-predefined-values.md), and whether the field is required. There are additional field-specific configurations as well.

![The Select from List field has several basic configurations.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/15.png)

Advanced configurations include [predefined values](../creating-and-managing-forms/providing-help-text-and-predefined-values.md), search configurations, whether the field is repeatable, and the read-only field ID. There are additional-field-specific configurations as well.

### Behavior Change: Read-Only Field ID Replaces Editable Field Name

In Liferay 7.3, the editable configuration Field Name was removed, and a read-only Field ID is included in each field's Advanced tab. Use the Field ID when referencing the field from [Form Rules](../form-rules/form-rules-overview.md) or programmatically.

```note::
   Since the Field ID is autogenerated and read-only, it has a reader-unfriendly value that's difficult to predict and use programmatically. To enhance third party developers' ability to write Forms code, a coming Liferay version will introduce a new configuration field that works similarly to the former Field Name. Field Reference will be added to the field configuration UI and will be editable, so that a human-readable name can be referenced by third party code.
```
## Form Fields and Elements

### Paragraph 

This is static text on the form, entered by the form creator. Users do not enter data into paragraph fields. This is useful for longer instructions.

![Paragraph fields can be used to provide longer instructions.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/02.png)

### Text Field 

Users enter free-form text into these fields. For example, a Full Name field is a text field. By default, a text field keeps all input on a single line of text. To accommodate longer responses, choose the multi-line setting when configuring the text field [as in this example](./creating-forms.md). You can put limits on the text users can enter (e.g., numbers from 1-10, email addresses, etc.) by using the text field's [validation options](./validating-text-and-numeric-field-entries.md).

![Multi-line text fields allow multiple lines of user input.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/03.png)

### Select from List 

Users select one option (or more, if configured to allow it) from a list of choices. Choices are entered manually or automatically populated by a [data provider](../data-providers/data-providers-overview.md). For example, a Country of Residence field can be selected from list field populated by a Countries of the World data provider.

![Select form List fields present users with a dropdown list of options to select from.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/04.png)

### Single Selection 

Using a radio button, users select one option from a list of options displayed on the form.

![Single Selection fields show users multiple options, allowing them to select just one.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/05.png)

### Date 

Users select a date using a date picker.

![Single Selection fields show users multiple options, allowing them to select just one.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/06.png)

### Multiple Selection 

Users select one or more options from check boxes (or toggles, if configured).

![Multiple selection fields let users choose more than one of the displayed options.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/07.png)

### Grid 

Using radio buttons, users select from options laid out in rows and columns. One selection can be made per row. This is useful when the same response metric is needed for multiple questions.

![Grid fields let users respond to multiple inquiries from the same list of responses options.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/08.png)

### Numeric 

Users enter numeric data (integers or decimals) into numeric fields. Non-numeric input is not accepted.

![Numeric fields restrict user input to numbers (integers or decimals).](./forms-field-types-reference/images/09.png)

### Upload 

Users can select a file from the Documents and Media library or upload a file from their local file systems.

![Upload fields let users upload files or select from existing Docs and Media entries.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/10.png)

On Liferay 7.3 (DXP FP1+ and CE GA7+), you can allow unauthenticated Guest Users to upload files. Enable Guest uploads within the Form Field's configuration:

![You can choose whether Guests are allowed to upload files.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/16.png)

Configure the Guest upload behavior in the Control Panel: System Settings &rarr; Forms (Content and Data) &rarr; Forms, or by creating a [configuration file](../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/configuration-files-and-factories/using-configuration-files.md) named `com.liferay.dynamic.data.mapping.form.web.internal.configuration.DDMFormWebConfiguration.config`.

```tip::
   To configure the Forms application at the `instance scope <../../../system-administration/configuring-liferay/understanding-configuration-scope.md#scope-definitions>`__, use the Forms entry in Instance Settings.
```

**Guest Upload File Extensions (`guestUploadFileExtensions`):** Enter the comma-separated list of accepted file extensions. By default the following list is supported: `doc`, `docx`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `pdf`, `png`, `ppt`, `pptx`, `tiff`, `txt`, `xls`, and `xlsx`.

**Guest Upload Maximum file Size (`guestUploadMaximumFileSize`):** Set the maximum file size Guest User can upload via the Upload field. This is configured for authenticated Users in the Documents and Media application's configuration, and system-wide limits are defined in the Upload Servlet Request System Settings entry, in the field named Overall Maximum Upload Request Size. By default the limit is 25 MB.

**Maximum Repetitions for Upload Fields (`maximumRepetitionsForUploadFields`):** If the field is configured as repeatable, set maximum number of times the field can be added to the form by the User (applies equally to Guest Users and logged in Users). By default the limit is 5.

**Maximum Submissions for Guest Upload Fields (`maximumSubmissionsForGuestUploadFields`):** Set the maximum number of times a Guest User can submit a form that includes a Guest-enabled Upload field. The Guest User's IP address is used to keep track of submissions. By default the limit is 5.

### Image 

Users can select an image file (`.gif`, `.jpeg`, `.jpg`, or `.png`) from Web Content Images, the Documents and Media library, or upload an image file from their local file systems.

![Image fields let users upload images or select from existing images in Docs and Media or Web Content Images.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/11.png)

```important::
   Guest Users cannot access or upload images. Avoid using this field unless only authenticated Users can access the form.
```

### Color 

Users can enter the hex code of a color by selecting it from the color picker or entering the code directly.

![Color fields let users enter a color's hex code by selecting the color form a color picker.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/13.png)

### Rich Text 

Users can enter Rich Text content (including formatted text, embedded images, attachments, etc.) into a form field.

![Rich Text fields let users write formatted text with embedded images in a form.](./forms-field-types-reference/images/12.png)
