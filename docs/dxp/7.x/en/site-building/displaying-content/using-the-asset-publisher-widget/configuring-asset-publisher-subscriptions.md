1. Toggle the *Enable Email Subscription* selector to Yes.
1. Fill in the form and click *Save* to apply the changes.

### Configuring the Asset Check Interval

Liferay Portal periodically checks for new assets and sends emails to subscribed users informing them about the new assets. By default, assets are checked every twenty-four hours. You can change the check interval through System Settings. Follow these steps:

1. Open the Product Menu and go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings*.
1. Select *Assets* under the *Content and Data* heading.
1. Go to *System Scope* &rarr; *Asset Publisher*. 
1. Change the *Check Interval* setting to the interval (in hours) that you want to check for new assets and notify subscribed users, and click *Save* to apply the changes.
