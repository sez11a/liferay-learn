# Verifying A/B Test Requirements

Before running A/B Testing on your Content pages, you must verify these requirements are met:

- Liferay DXP is connected to Analytics Cloud. Fore information on how to set up this connection, see [Connecting your Liferay DXP site to Analytics Cloud](https://learn.liferay.com/analytics-cloud/latest/en/getting-started/connecting-data-sources/connecting-liferay-dxp-to-analytics-cloud.html).

- Your page is a [Content Page](../../creating-pages/understanding-pages/understanding-pages.md). Widget Pages do not support Experiences for different Segments.
- The Content Page you intend to test is published.
- You have the *Update* permission in the Content Page.
