# Building Responsive Layouts with the Grid Fragment

> Availability: Liferay DXP 7.3+.

Liferay DXP [uses responsive design](./building-a-responsive-site.md) by default, but there are situations where you want additional and more granular control of the content layout. Using the [Grid Fragment](../../creating-pages/building-and-managing-content-pages/building-content-pages.md#configuring-the-grid-fragment) in your Content Page, you have a precise control of the content layout for the different screen sizes in desktop and mobile devices. When you [edit a Content Page](../../creating-pages/building-and-managing-content-pages/editing-content-pages.md), you can use the the Grid Fragment (A) to outline your content and define customized layout styles (B) for the different target devices in the Device Display section (C). For example you can customize the number of modules per row or the grid padding options for smartphone-size screens only.

Consider the following example. The 'Services' section of your insurance company website provides potential customers an overview of the services you offer. This section uses a series of Card Fragments (A) inside a three-modules Grid Fragment (B), with information for the three different services in this example.

When you access this 'Services' Content Pages from your computer, the grid layout shows the expected result. However, when you access the page from your smartphone, the result is not optimal because of the amount of text on each Card Fragment (C) and the grid's padding size (D). Using the Grid Fragment Styles, you can now customize the number of cards you want to show on each module and modify other style properties for the best viewing experience on different screen sizes.
