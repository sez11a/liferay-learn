# Managing Page Hierarchies

Using the Page Hierarchy, you create public and private pages and organize those pages in whatever order or structure that you see fit.

## Creating a Page

New pages are created on the _Site Builder_ &rarr; _Pages_ page in _Site Administration_. Pages can be created as _Public Pages_ which anyone can view, or _Private Pages_ which can only be viewed by Site Members. See [Adding a Page to a Site](../creating-pages/adding-pages/adding-a-page-to-a-site.md) to learn how to add a page.

Now that the page is created, it appears in the hierarchy, and you can move or organize its position there.

## Organizing Pages

Drag and drop pages to reorder their position in the page hierarchy (and subsequently the default navigation that users see) or to nest them as sub-pages. The page at the top of the list is the first page that users see automatically when visiting your Site. You can treat this as the site's landing page.

### Reordering Pages

To reorder your pages:

1. Navigate to the your site's _Site Administration_.
1. Click _Site Builder_ &rarr; _Pages_.

    ![The Site Builder is where you can manage your pages.](./managing-page-hierarchies/images/01.png)

1. Drag and drop _Page 2_ above _Page 3_ page.
1. Click _Home_ to see the changes.

    ![Page 2 is now before Page 3.](./managing-page-hierarchies/images/02.png)

The page order has been changed.

### Nesting Pages

You can nest pages up to four levels. Follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the your site's _Site Administration_.
1. Click _Site Builder_ &rarr; _Pages_.
1. Drag and drop _Page 3_ inside _Page 2_ to nest it.
1. Drag _Page 2_ inside _Page 1_.

    ![Page 3 has been nested into page 2 which is nested in Page 1.](./managing-page-hierarchies/images/03.png)

1. Click _Home_ to view the nested pages.

### Public and Private Pages

As noted above, Private Pages work just like Public Pages, except they can be viewed only by registered members of a Site. In the default configuration, Public Pages are at the URL `[web-address]/`**web**`/[site-name]` while Private Pages are at `[web-address]/`**group**`/[site-name]`. Other than the membership distinctions, Public and Private Pages share the same behavior.

## Configuring Page Options

Users can access page options by clicking on the _Options_ (![Option](../../images/icon-options.png)) icon.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **View** | View the selected page on the Site. |
| **Configure** | View the Page Configuration screen. |
| **Copy Page** | Create a new page in the current Site that duplicates the selected page. |
| **Permissions** | Configure the page's Permissions. |
| **Orphan Widgets** | Clears the data related to widgets that have been removed from the page. |
| **Delete** | Deletes the page and all its data. |
