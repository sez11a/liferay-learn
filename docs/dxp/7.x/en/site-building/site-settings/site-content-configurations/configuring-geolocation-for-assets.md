# Configuring Geolocation for Assets

<!-- This article could use an introductory paragraph that answers: what geolocated assets are - IDEALLY we present a screenshot of an asset being displayed in liferay that shows geolocation data included. This gives the reader a sense of what this article is helping them accomplish. -->
