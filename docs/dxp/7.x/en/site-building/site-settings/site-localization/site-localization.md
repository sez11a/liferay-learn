# Site Localization

## Configuring Site Languages

1. In the [Site Settings UI](../site-settings-ui-reference.md), click on the Languages tab.

## Modifying Localizable Site Fields

Some Site setting fields have a language flag appended to the end. These fields can be translated into other languages.

To modify a localizable field,

1. Click the language flag beside the field.

    ![Click the language flag next to the localizable field to enter a new value.](images/05.png)

1. Enter the new value in the selected language. The default value is displayed beneath the field for reference.

    ![Enter the new value for the selected language.](images/06.png)

Liferay DXP automatically saves the translation for each language and displays the translated value when that specific language is selected for the instance. If a translation for the field is not provided, the default instance language's value for that field is displayed.
