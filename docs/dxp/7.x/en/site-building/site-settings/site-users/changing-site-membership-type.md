# Changing Site Membership Type

A Site's membership type determines how freely users may join your site. There are three types of site membership:

**Open:** Users can join and leave whenever they want. The site is visible to all users in the My Sites app.

**Restricted:** Site is visible in the My Sites app and users must request membership to join.

**Private:** A Site Administrator must explicitly invite a User to join and then add them to the Site. Private membership Sites don't appear in the My Sites app.

## Setting Site Membership Type

To change your Site's membership type, follow these steps:

1. Open the Product Menu and go to *Configuration* &rarr; *Settings* (previously *Site Settings*) &rarr; and scroll down to the *Membership Options* sub-heading under *Details*.
