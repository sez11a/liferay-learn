# Migrating User Segments

A user segment represents a subset of users with a common set of properties. [Segmentation](./segmentation/creating-and-managing-user-segments.md) in Liferay DXP 7.2+ works similarly to Audience Targeting in previous Liferay DXP versions. In Audience Targeting, you create rules that users must match to belong to a user segment. In Segmentation, you create conditions that can be combined in different ways to define complex filters. For more information on how to create user Segments, see [Creating and Managing User Segments](./segmentation/creating-and-managing-user-segments.md).

## Upgrade Paths for Audience Targeting Rules

Due to the similarities between Audience Targeting user segments and Liferay DXP 7.2+ Segments, certain data is migrated automatically during the Liferay upgrade process. The following table shows the upgrade path for Audience Targeting rules when migrating to Liferay Segments conditions:
