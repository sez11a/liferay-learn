# About A/B Testing

```note::
   A/B Testing is available for Liferay DXP 7.2 SP1+.
```

With A/B Testing, you can show different versions of your site to different users and determine which version is more effective. Using A/B Testing, you maintain the current content and design of your webpage for the majority of the visitors, while providing an alternative page variant for a selected group of them. The current page and the page variant(s) are then tested to determine which version performs better for a given goal (like bounce rate, clicks, etc.).

For example, a Marketing team for a bank provides a Content Page advertising a new credit card. The page has been published for a few weeks, but a redesign might help to promote the new credit card better. With A/B Testing, the team can create a new page variant and display both pages at random to visitors. Then, they can compare the clickthrough rate for the two pages and find which page is more effective. If the new variant is more effective than the original page, they can publish it and replace the original page.
