    * **Open:** Users can become members of the Site at any time.
    * **Restricted:** Users can request Site membership but Site Administrators must approve requests for users to become members.

```tip::
   In order to view a newly created *blank site*, you must first create a page for it. See `Adding a Page to a Site <../creating-pages/adding-pages/adding-a-page-to-a-site.md>`_ for more information.
```

The new Site is selected when you open the Product Menu. See [Site Settings](../site_settings.md) for an overview of all of the available Site settings.
