# Auto-Deploying Fragments

> Available: Liferay Portal CE 7.3 GA1+ and Liferay DXP 7.3+

If you're [developing Page Fragments with your own tooling](./using-the-fragments-toolkit.md#collection-format-overview), you can deploy them by packaging them in ZIP files for importing via the Liferay UI. But you're not limited to using the UI. You can deploy Fragment ZIP files from the command line too. Here you'll learn how to work with Fragment projects and import the Fragments to the Sites you want from the command line using Liferay's auto-deployment mechanism.

Start with auto-deploying an example Fragment Collection.

## Deploy an Auto-deployable Fragment Collection

Start with auto-deploying an example Fragment Collection.

1. Run the command below to start the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run -it -p 8080:8080 [$LIFERAY_LEARN_DXP_DOCKER_IMAGE$]
    ```

1. Download and unzip the [example auto-deployable Fragment Collection](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/7.x/en/site-building/developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/liferay-a2f8.zip):

    ```bash
    curl https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/7.x/en/site-building/developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/liferay-a2f8.zip -O
    ```

    ```bash
    unzip liferay-a2f8.zip -d liferay-a2f8
    ```

1. Compress the Fragment project's Collection and its deployment descriptor into a ZIP file:

    ```bash
    cd liferay-a2f8
    ```

    ```bash
    zip -r  a2f8-fragments.zip a2f8-collection/ liferay-deploy-fragments.json
    ```

1. Import the Fragments Collection to the descriptor-specified Site by copying the new `.zip` file to the auto-deploy folder in Liferay's Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker cp a2f8-fragments.zip $(docker ps -lq):/opt/liferay/deploy
    ```

1. Check the Docker console for this log message:

    ```bash
    INFO  [com.liferay.portal.kernel.deploy.auto.AutoDeployScanner][AutoDeployDir:263] Processing a2f8-fragments.zip
    ```

1. Verify that the Fragment Collection is available. Open your browser to `https://localhost:8080`. From the Site Menu on the left side of the screen, go to *Design* &rarr; *Fragments*. The *A2F8 Collection* is in the Fragment Collections list.

## Deployment Descriptor Overview

Auto-deployable Fragment project ZIP files have this structure:

```
[project ZIP]
├── [fragment-collection]
│   ├── collection.json
│   └── [fragment]
│       └── fragment files ...
└── liferay-deploy-fragments.json

```

The `liferay-deploy-fragments.json` file specifies the scope where you want to deploy the Fragments:

* System-wide (all instances)
* a virtual instance (Company)
* a Site (group).

The example's configuration below specifies deploying to a Site (group) called "Guest" within a virtual instance (liferay.com):

```json
{
    "companyWebId": "liferay.com",
    "groupKey": "Guest"
}
```

Both keys in this JSON file are optional. In your `liferay-deploy-fragments.json` file, you can make Fragments available system-wide (to all instances) by specifying an empty JSON element or by adding this configuration:

```json
{
    "companyWebId": "*"
}
```

```note::
   The Fragments Toolkit's `npm run compress command <./using-the-fragments-toolkit.md>`_ facilitates creating Fragment ZIP files and their deployment descriptors.
```

## Modify the Fragment Collection and Redeploy

Follow these steps to modify the Fragment Collection and redeploy it:

1. Add a new Fragment to the example Collection by moving the project's `a2f8-jumbotron` Fragment folder into the `a2f8-collection/` folder. 
1. Compress the Collection into a ZIP file as you did above:

    ```bash
    zip -r  a2f8-fragments.zip a2f8-collection/ liferay-deploy-fragments.json
    ```

1. Import the modified Collection by copying the ZIP file to the Docker container as you did previously:

   ```bash
   docker cp a2f8-fragments.zip $(docker ps -lq):/opt/liferay/deploy
   ```

1. Check for the new Fragment. In the Site Menu, go to *Design* &rarr; *Fragments* and then click on the *A2F8 Collection*. The A2F8 Jumbotron Fragment is in the Collection.

    ![The new Fragment is included in the auto-deployed Collection.](./auto-deploying-fragments/images/02.png)

Great! Now you know how to work with a Fragment Collection locally, specify a Site for it, and import it using auto-deployment.
