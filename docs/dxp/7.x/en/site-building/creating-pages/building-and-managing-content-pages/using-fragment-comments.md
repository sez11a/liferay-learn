# Enabling and Using Fragment Comments

As you and your team use Fragments to create new pages, you can use the Fragment Comments tool for collaboration.

## Enabling Fragment Comments

Fragment Comments are enabled out-of-the-box in Liferay DXP 7.3, but they are disabled by default in Liferay DXP 7.2.

To enable comments for Fragments, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Control Paneel and navigate to *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Content and Data* &rarr; *Pages*.

1. Select *Content Page Editor* under the Virtual Instance Scope. Check the *Comments Enabled* checkbox and click the *Save* button.

    You should now be able to use Fragment Comments.

    Note that this affects content page comments for all instances. To control this on an instance-by-instance basis, navigate to the same setting in *Instance Settings* (instead of *System Settings*).
