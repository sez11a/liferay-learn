# Content Pages Overview

```note::
   Liferay DXP 7.3+. For previous Liferay DXP versions, see `Liferay DXP 7.1 and 7.2 <#liferay-dxp-7-1-and-7-2>`_.
```

The default page type in Liferay DXP is a Content Page. Its editing UI contains many different drag-and-drop elements (Fragments and Widgets) you can use with minimal configuration. To jump directly into building a Content Page, see [Building Content Pages](./building-content-pages.md).

There are two editing modes: Page Design and Content Edition, and each have different options.

![Choose between Page Design or Content Edition editing modes.](building-content-pages/images/18.png)

*Page Design* mode contains these action elements in the Content Page sidebar.

* ![Comments](../../../images/icon-comments-w.png) - [Comments](#comments)

## Fragments and Widgets

Fragments and Widgets elements that you can drag-and-drop to build your content.

* [Fragments](#fragments)

    Fragments can have editable elements, such as [text](./building-content-pages.md#editing-text-inline), [images](./building-content-pages.md#editing-images), or [links](./building-content-pages.md#editing-hyperlinks), that you can replace with custom content. You can also [map these elements](./building-content-pages.md#mapping-content) to content that is already available on the Site itself. For more information on developing Fragments, see [Fragment Specific Tags](../../developer-guide/reference/fragments/fragment-specific-tags-reference.md).

    ![The Fragments panel provides a list of Fragments that can be added inside the page editor.](./content-pages-overview/images/01.png)

* [Widgets](#widgets)

    Widgets are [applications](../../../developing_applications.html) that you can add to the page.

    ![The Widgets panel provides a list of Widgets that can be added inside the page editor.](./content-pages-overview/images/02.png)

### Fragments

You can find the following Fragments under the Content Page sidebar:

* [Layout Elements](#layout-elements)
* [Basic Components](#basic-components)
* [Content Display](#content-display)
* [Featured Content](#featured-content)
* [Footers](#footers)
* [Navigation Bars](#navigation-bars)

#### Layout Elements

The Layout Elements section contains two Fragments:

* *Container*: A Fragment that can contain Rows. Each Section you add fills the width of the page. A Section can contain multiple stacked Rows.
* *Grid*: A Fragment containing a set of columns where Fragments or Widgets can be added. A Row can be nested inside another Row to create more complex layouts. For more information, [Configuring the Grid Fragment](./building-content-pages.md#configuring-the-grid-fragment).

    ![The Layouts panel contains layouts for organizing Fragments.](content-pages-overview/images/03.png)

#### Basic Components

Basic Components are small design elements that add functionality to the page: an image with formatting or a block of text with styling pre-applied. Components work together to build pages piece by piece.

![Several out of the box components can be arranged in a grid layout.](./content-pages-overview/images/04.png)

#### Content Display

You can display web content, a blog entry, or a document by adding a Content Fragment from the *Content Display* panel. See [Using the Content Display Fragment](./using-fragments.md#using-the-content-fragment) for more information.

![Use Content Display fragments to display existing web content.](./content-pages-overview/images/05.png)

#### Featured Content

The *Featured Content* panel contains complete Fragments (composed of multiple components) that can be immediately used and customized as soon as they are added to a page. A large banner image with a text overlay and customizable CTA (Call to Action) is an example of a Fragment that is ready for immediate use.

![A Section named Banner being displayed while editing a Content Page.](./content-pages-overview/images/06.png)

#### Footers

The *Footers* panel includes Fragments for page footers. See [Master Pages](../defining-headers-and-footers/master-page-templates.md) for their use.

#### Navigation Bars

The *Navigation Bars* panel includes Fragments for page headers. See [Master Pages](../defining-headers-and-footers/master-page-templates.md) for their use.

### Widgets

See [Using Widgets on Content Pages](./using-widgets-on-a-content-page.md) for more information on how to use Widgets for your Content Page.

```note::
   While widgets are rendered according to `render-weight <https://docs.liferay.com/ce/portal/7.3-latest/definitions/liferay-portlet-app_7_3_0.dtd.html#render-weight>`_ on Widget Pages, that is not true for Content Pages. Widgets are rendered in the order they appear on the page on Content Pages (i.e. left to right, top to bottom).
```

## Contents

The Contents panel provides a list of the web content on the page. This includes content displayed in a widget and content mapped to content fields. Click the *Contents* button (![Contents](../../../images/icon-list-ul.png)) to open the Contents panel. From this panel, you can perform a variety of actions to edit and manage web content. See [Managing Web Content on Content Pages](./managing-web-content-on-content-pages.md) for more information.

## Page Structure

Page Structure provides a hierarchical view of the Fragments and their content on the page. Choose a field in the page structure to highlight it on the page. Headers and Footers appear in the hierarchy as well for custom [Master Page Templates](../defining-headers-and-footers/master-page-templates.md), but they're disabled because they can only be modified from the Master Page Template.

![Page Structure shows you a hierarchy of your page and contents.](./content-pages-overview/images/08.png)

## Page Design Options

Click the *Page Design Options* icon (![Look and Feel](../../../images/icon-look-and-feel.png)) to change the theme or manage other options for the page. These options are further explored in [Page Configuration UI Reference](../page-settings/page-configuration-ui-reference.md#look-and-feel).

## Comments

Use Page Fragment comments to collaborate with team members while developing your Content Page. To make a comment, begin editing a Content Page and click on the Page Fragment you want to annotate. Then click the *Comment* icon (![Comment icon](../../../images/icon-comments-w.png)) for the Fragment. You can view and respond to open fragment comments via the Comments panel in the Content Page sidebar.

If comment mentions are enabled, you can mention Users with Page update permissions as part of your comment. See [Mentioning Users](./../../../collaboration-and-social/notifications-and-requests/user-guide/mentioning-users.md) for more information.

## Liferay DXP 7.1 and 7.2

Unlike Widget Pages, Content Pages can only be edited through the Site Builder and cannot be edited live on the page. Any edits that you make to a page are saved as a draft until you publish the page. Subsequent changes after the initial publication are again saved as a draft without affecting the live page, until the page is published again.

### Creating Content Pages

1.  Go to *Site Management* &rarr; *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

2.  Click ![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png).

3.  On the next page, select *Content Page* and provide a name for the page.

    You will be brought to the Content Page management interface.
 
    ![Each Content Page starts as a blank page.](./content-pages-overview/images/20.png)

To edit an existing Content Page,

1.  Go to *Site Administration* &rarr; *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages*.

2.  Click *Actions* (![Actions](../../../images/icon-staging-bar-options.png))
    &rarr; *Edit* next to the Content Page you want to edit.

You can also get to this page by selecting the *Edit* button (![Edit](../../../images/icon-edit-pencil.png)) from the Control Menu if you're viewing the published Content Page.

Here you can view a preview of your page, add Fragments and Widgets, and manage the configuration for the page or any Fragments and Widgets currently residing on the page.

Your tools for building the page are all found on the right side of the page. From top to bottom, the options are

* [Sections](#sections)
* [Section Builder](#section-builder)
* [Widgets](#widgets)
* [Page Structure](#page-structure)
* [Look and Feel](#look-and-feel)

### Sections

When you open *Sections* you see a list of Collections available. Initially, you only have the **Basic Sections** Collection which is included with the product. You can open the Collection and drag Sections directly onto the page.

![Sections contains Fragments that fully define spaces on your page.](./content-pages-overview/images/21.png)

Once a section is added to a page, you can edit its background color, background image, and spacing. Since these options are available to page editors, the options are limited, and the color palette can be set by the Fragment developer.

![The Section management tool provide powerful tools, but with the training wheels still on.](./content-pages-overview/images/22.png)

### Section Builder

In Section Builder, you start with *Layouts* and *Basic Components*. Add Layouts to the page to provide a space where you can add Components.

![Sections Builder contains Component Fragments which are intended to be combined to create Sections.](./content-pages-overview/images/23.png)

### Widgets

The Widgets section functions just like the *Add* menu on a Widget Page. The full list of available widgets appears, and you can add them to the page.

![The Widgets section provides a list of Widgets that can be added inside of a Layout.](./content-pages-overview/images/24.png)

The main difference is that only the main configuration options for widgets on Content Pages. Various other configurations like *Look and Feel* are only available for widgets on Widget Pages.

### Page Structure

Page Structure provides a high level view of every Fragment and every field within each Fragment on the page.

![Page Structure shows you a hierarchy of your page.](./content-pages-overview/images/25.png)

Choosing a field in Page Structure highlights it on the page. On large complicated page, this helps you find everything.

### Look and Feel

Click the *Look and Feel* icon (![Look and Feel](../../../images/icon-look-and-feel.png)) to change the theme or manage other options for the page. These options are fully documented in [Creating Pages](/dxp/7.x/en/site-building/creating_pages.html). 

### Comments

You can also comment on any page fragments. This allows discussion and collaboration for teams creating content pages. 

Comments are disabled by default, but administrators can enable them from *Control Panel* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings* &rarr; *Pages* &rarr; *Content Page Editor*. Select the *Comments Enabled* checkbox and click *Update*. This enables content page comments for all instances. To control this on an instance-by-instance basis, navigate to the same setting in *Instance Settings* (instead of System Settings). 

![Administrators can enable comments for content pages.](./content-pages-overview/images/26.png)

If comments are enabled, you can access them via the *Comments* icon (![Comments](../../../images/icon-comments.png)). The comments appear for the selected fragment. You can take the following actions in the comments UI for a fragment:

*   Add new comments and reply to any existing ones. 
*   Resolve comments by clicking the checkbox for each. Resolving a comment 
    hides it from view, unless *Show Resolved Comments* is selected. 
*   Edit and delete your own comments via the Actions button 
    (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) 
    for each. 

If you de-select a fragment or enter the comments UI without a fragment selected, a list of the fragments on the page appears with the number of comments for each. Selecting a fragment then shows its comments. 

![When creating content pages, you and your team can comment on any fragments.](./content-pages-overview/images/27.png)

### The Title Bar

The title bar provides navigation back to the Main Menu, a link to page configuration, and the ability to search for other pages. The title bar is covered in more detail in [Creating Pages](/dxp/7.x/en/site-building/creating_pages.html). 

![The title bar has several tools built into it.](./content-pages-overview/images/28.png)

Great! Now you know how to use the content page interface!
