# Understanding Roles and Permissions

To get things done in Liferay DXP, [Users](./../users/understanding-users.md) must have the proper permissions. Roles join Users with permissions. Most administrative work for Roles and permissions is done in *Control Panel* &rarr; *Users* &rarr; *Roles*.

To skip straight to creating Roles and assigning Users, see

- [Role Creation and Management](./creating-and-managing-roles.md)
- [Defining Role Permissions](./defining-role-permissions.md)
- [Assigning Users to Roles](./assigning-users-to-roles.md)

```note::
   `Site Teams <./../../site-building/building-sites/creating-teams-for-sites.md>`_ have a dedicated permissions management User Interface.
```

## Roles

To give Users the permissions they need to perform their intended function within Liferay DXP, you must first mate the set of permissions with a Role.

Using a _Message Boards Admin_ Role and a User _Jane Slaughter_ as an example, here are the steps you might follow:

1. Determine the function needed: _Manage Message Boards in Liferay DXP._
1. Determine the scope: _Throughout the Virtual Instance (globally)._
1. Create the properly scoped Role, assigning the permissions that power the function: _Message Boards Admin (Regular Role)._
1. Create the User collection: _a User Group called Message Boards Administrators._
1. Assign the Role to the User Collection: _Message Boards Administrators &rarr; Message Boards Admin Role._
1. Assign Users to the User Collection: _Jane Slaughter &rarr; Message Boards Administrators._

The conceptual diagram below shows how the User inherits the necessary permissions in Liferay DXP's Roles and Permissions system. Only one fully-wired Role assignment is displayed here (for the User who becomes a Message Boards Administrator), but you can see how drawing new arrows would link the User with permissions via other User collections and Role assignments.

Roles have scope, so they apply at different levels.

| Permission Scope | Role Type | Where is it assigned to Users? | Available Assignments |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------- | --------- |
| Throughout the Virtual Instance (global) | Regular   | Control Panel &rarr; Users &rarr; Roles (Click on the Role) &rarr; Assignees | User Groups <br />Organizations <br />Sites <br />Segments <br />Individual Users |
| A single Organization | Organization | Control Panel &rarr; Users &rarr; Users and Organizations &rarr; Organizations (Organization actions menu) | Individual Users |
| A single Site    | Site   | Site Administration &rarr; People &rarr; Memberships | User Groups <br />Organizations <br />Segments <br />Individual Site Members |
| A single Account | Account   | Control Panel &rarr; Accounts &rarr; Accounts (Select Account) &rarr; Roles | Individual Account Members
| A single Asset Library | Asset Library | Site/Library Administration of Asset Library &rarr; People &rarr; Memberships | Organizations <br />User Groups <br /> Individual Users |

Individual [Users](./../users/understanding-users.md) can be manually assigned to Roles. It's just less efficient than using collections of Users. Users can also be [automatically](../../system-administration/virtual-instances/configuring-a-virtual-instance-users.md#default-user-associations) assigned to Roles of all scopes through a Virtual Instance Setting called Default User Associations.

### Regular Roles 

Instance scoped Roles are called Regular Roles. These Roles grant permissions globally, or throughout the [Virtual Instance](./../../system-administration/virtual_instances.rst).

Several User collections can be assigned to Regular Roles:

- [Organizations](./../organizations/understanding-organizations.md) hold Users of a shared hierarchical level.
- [User Groups](./../user-groups/creating-and-managing-user-groups.md) hold Users that only share the need to perform the same function.
- [Sites](./../../site-building/building-sites/adding-members-to-sites.md) hold Users (as Site Members) that might need to perform a certain action.
- [Segments](./../../site-building/personalizing-site-experience/segmentation/creating-and-managing-user-segments.md) hold Users of a Site that match certain conditions.

### Organization Roles

Organization scoped Roles are called Organization Roles. Permissions for Organization Roles are defined at the global level and are applied to one specific [Organization](../../users-and-permissions/organizations/understanding-organizations.md). Users are added to Organizations individually and are assigned to Organization Roles individually.

### Site Roles

Site scoped Roles are called Site Roles. Permissions for Site Roles are defined at the global level and are applied to one specific [Site](../../site-building/introduction-to-site-building.md). Individual Users, Organizations, and User Groups can be used both to control Site Membership and assign Site Roles.

## Permissions

Permissions are created by developers of applications. They define actions Users can perform or how much access a User has to a particular asset. 

### Application Scoped Permissions

Permissions can be granted on each widget instance that's placed on a page in Liferay DXP, and each administrative application in the Site Menu &rarr; Content and Data section. See [Widget Permissions](./../../site-building/widget-permissions.md) for details.

### Asset Scoped Permissions

Asset-level permissions (for instance, permission to edit an individual blog post, or view a folder in the Documents and Media library) are managed from the individual asset, not the Control Panel. See [Widget Permissions](./../../site-building/widget-permissions.md) for details.
