# Exporting User Data

One of the General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR) tenets is that Users have a right to _data portability_.

Data portability means that a User has the right to receive their personal data in a machine-readable format.

The Control Panel's User Management system natively supports the export of a User's personal data to a ZIP file for download. The data format for the data files is XML.

## Exporting and Downloading

To export user data,

1. Open the Applications Menu (![Applications Menu](../../images/icon-applications-menu.png)).

1. Go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Users* &rarr; *Users and Organizations*.

1. Find the User and click the Actions button (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)), then click *Export Personal Data*.

   This opens the User's Export Personal Data screen.

1. If there are no existing export processes shown, there's only one thing to do: click the *Add* button (![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)). The tool for exporting the User's data appears.

1. Most of the time you want to export all the available data. Click *Select Items*, and all applications containing User data are selected in the UI.

1. Click *Export*. You're taken back to the User's Export Personal Data screen, but now there's an export process in the list.

1. Download the data. Click the Actions button (![Actions](../../images/icon-actions.png)) for the process and select *Download*.

## Examining Exported Data

So what does the exported data look like?

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

<model>
    <model-name>com.liferay.message.boards.model.MBMessage</model-name>
    <column>
        <column-name>messageId</column-name>
        <column-value><![CDATA[38099]]></column-value>
    </column>
    <column>
        <column-name>statusByUserId</column-name>
        <column-value><![CDATA[38045]]></column-value>
    </column>
    <column>
        <column-name>statusByUserName</column-name>
        <column-value><![CDATA[Jane Slaughter]]></column-value>
    </column>
    <column>
        <column-name>userId</column-name>
        <column-value><![CDATA[38045]]></column-value>
    </column>
    <column>
        <column-name>userName</column-name>
        <column-value><![CDATA[Jane Slaughter]]></column-value>
    </column>
    <column>
        <column-name>subject</column-name>
        <column-value><![CDATA[Great list. I was thinking of bringing the family,...]]></column-value>
    </column>
    <column>
        <column-name>body</column-name>
        <column-value><![CDATA[<p>Great list. I was thinking of bringing the family, but I don&#39;t
  actually believe humans have ever been to the moon, so I guess it
  would be silly to book a trip! LOL!</p>]]></column-value>
    </column>
</model>
```

In this example, User Jane Slaughter made a Message Boards Message post, and her User information was recorded in the `MBMessage` model's database table.

This actually corresponds with a comment on a Blogs Entry:

Exporting User data informs Site Owners and Users about how much personal data the Site may have.
