## Installing the CLI Tool

### \*nix Systems

Open your terminal, and run the following command:

```bash
curl https://cdn.liferay.cloud/lcp/stable/latest/install.sh -fsSL | bash
```

If you get a permissions error, try running the same command with `sudo`.

### Windows Systems

Download the latest version of the [Windows installer](https://cdn.liferay.cloud/lcp/stable/latest/lcp-install.exe), and follow the steps in the wizard.

## Upgrading the CLI Tool from Version 2 to 3

You must first uninstall your current version before you can install and use version 3. This prevent conflicts with the same binary name.

```important::
   The following instructions are specific to uninstalling CLI version 2 and are **not** the same as those for `uninstalling version 3 of the CLI tool <#uninstalling-version-3-of-the-cli-tool>`__.
```

### Uninstalling Version 2 on MacOS or Linux

1. Open a terminal and run: `lcp uninstall`.

1. Verify uninstall is complete by running the command `lcp`.

### Uninstalling Version 2 on Windows

1. On Windows 10, go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Programs* &rarr; *Uninstall a program*. Alternatively, for Windows 7 and 8, go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Add or Remove Programs*.

1. Select `lcp amd64-installer-0.3`

1. Click _Uninstall_ then confirm.

1. Verify uninstall is complete by running the command `lcp` or `lcp.exe`.

Verify that CLI version 2 has been uninstalled before installing version 3.

### Installing Version 3

Once version 2 is uninstalled, you can following the [above instructions](#installing-the-cli-tool) to install version 3 of the CLI tool.

## Configuring the CLI Remote

To access DXP Cloud services via the CLI tool, it must be configured to point to DXP Cloud's remote URL: `liferay.cloud`. To list the CLI's remotes, run the following command:

```shell
lcp remote
```

You can add new remotes to the CLI tool using the following command:

```shell
lcp remote set <remote-alias> <remote-url>
```

If desired, you can change its default remote:

```shell
lcp remote default <remote-alias>
```

Alternatively, you can specify the remote inline:

```shell
lcp shell -p <project-id> --service <service-id> --remote <remote-alias>
```

## Showing the Service Logs

Use `lcp log` commands to display logs for specific projects, services, and instances. The following examples include some common commands, though you can see available command options by running `lcp log --help`.

View all service logs for a project environment:

```shell
lcp log -p <project>-<environment>
```

View logs for a single service in a project environment:

```shell
lcp log -p <project>-<environment> -s <service>
```

Alternatively, use a service's full URL to view its logs:

```shell
lcp log --url <service>-<project>-<environment>.lfr.cloud
```

By default, the `lcp log` command only returns 10,000 lines to reduce network impact. However, you can avoid this restriction by using `--since` and `--until` parameters to specify a period of time (e.g., `yesterday`, `"yesterday at 9pm"`, `"10 minutes ago"`, `"mm/dd/YYYY HH:mm:ss"`).

View all service logs for a project environment from a specific time to the present:

```shell
lcp log -p <project>-<environment> --since <start_time>
```

View all service logs for a project environment from a specific period of time:

```shell
lcp log --since "<start_time>" --until "<end_time>"
```

You can also pipe the output of an `lcp log` command into a file by appending `>> "<new-file.txt>"` to the end of the command. When run, the new file is created in your terminal's current path.

```shell
lcp log -p <project>-<environment> -s <service> --since "<start_time>" --until "<end_time>" >> "<new-file.txt>"
```

## Changing the Number of Service Instances

Use `lcp scale` commands to individually scale environment services. The following examples include some common commands, though you can see available command options by running `lcp scale --help`.

View all services and their instances for a project environment, and then select a service to scale:

```shell
lcp scale -p <project>-<environment>
```

Then, follow the terminal prompts to select a service and determine the number of its instances.

Alternatively, specify the target service and desired number of instances as part of the `lcp scale` command:

```shell
lcp scale -p <project>-<environment> -s <service> <instances>
```

You can also scale instances using its full URL:

```shell
lcp scale --url <service>-<project>-<environment>.lfr.cloud <instances>
```

## Listing Projects or Services

Use `lcp list` commands to view project services, each with its image and status. The following examples include some common commands, though you can see available command options by running `lcp list --help`.

View a complete list of projects, services, and instances that you either own or collaborate on:

```shell
lcp list
```

View the image and status of environment specific services:

```shell
lcp list -p <project>-<environment>
```

Check the image and status of a specific service:

```shell
lcp list -p <project>-<environment> --service <serviceID>
```

Alternatively, you can check a service by passing its full URL to `lcp list`:

```shell
lcp list --url <service>-<project>-<environment>.lfr.cloud
```

## Restarting a Service

Use `lcp restart` commands to restart an environment service. The following examples include some common commands, though you can see available command options by running `lcp restart --help`.

View all project environments and services, and then select an environment service to restart:

```shell
lcp restart
```

Restart a specific service in a project:

```shell
lcp restart -p <project>-<environment> -s <service>
```

Alternatively, restart a service by passing its full URL to `lcp restart`:

```shell
lcp restart --url <serviceID>-<projectID>.lfr.cloud
```

## Accessing a Service's Shell

To access a service container's shell, run the following command:

```shell
lcp shell
```

This lists all the services in the container and prompts you to choose
which one to access.

Alternatively, access the shell of a specific service's container by adding the
service's project ID and service ID to the `lcp shell` command:

```shell
lcp shell -p <project>-<environment> -s <service>
```

## Open docs

Use the `lcp docs` command to access Liferay DXP Cloud resources, including official documentation, Help Center content, and more.

## Uninstalling Version 3 of the CLI Tool

For Mac and Linux, run the following command:

```bash
curl https://cdn.liferay.cloud/lcp/stable/latest/uninstall.sh -fsSL | bash
```

For Windows 7 and 8, go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Add or Remove Programs*. In Windows 10, go to *Control Panel* &rarr; *Programs* &rarr; *Uninstall a program*. Then, find *LCP CLI* in the list of programs, select it, and click *Uninstall*. Follow the steps in the wizard.
