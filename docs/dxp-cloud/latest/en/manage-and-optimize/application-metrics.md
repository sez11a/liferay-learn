# Application Metrics

With Liferay DXP Cloud's built-in monitoring, you can track resources used by each environment service. These application metrics include memory and CPU usage, as well as network data transfer. Metrics are available for the default DXP Cloud stack services: Webserver, Liferay, Search, Database, and Backup.

## Service Popover

You can quickly see a service's current resource usage from several pages in your DXP Cloud environment, including the environment's _Overview_ and _Services_ pages, and the individual service pages. View a popover of any service's resource usage by hovering over the service's icon.

## Extended Application Metrics

Users can view extended service metrics from the *Monitoring* page:

1. Click *Monitoring* in the environment menu.
1. Use the drop-down menus to select the service and time frame you want to monitor.

Users can also view extended service metrics from the *Services* page:

1. Click *Services* in the environment menu.

1. Click on the *Service* you want to monitor.

1. Click on the *Metrics* tab.

## Determining Resources Allocated to Services

A service's `LCP.json` file configuration determines the total memory and CPUs allocated to that service, and the application metrics show the usage of those resources over time.

Here is an example of CPU and Memory allocation for the `liferay` service in its `LCP.json` file:

```
"id": "liferay",

"memory": 8192,
"cpu": 8
```

Users can view allocated resources from the DXP Cloud console.

## Advanced Application Metrics (Production Only)

With Liferay DXP Cloud, you can integrate [Dynatrace's](https://www.dynatrace.com/) advanced performance monitoring with your production environments.

### Integrating Dynatrace with Production Environments

Follow these steps to integrate Dynatrace:

1. Create a Dynatrace account.

1. Generate the Dynatrace secret `token` and `tenant` values.

1. Add Dynatrace environment variables to the `LCP.json` file in the Liferay service's production environment. For example:

```json
{
	"environments": {
	  "prd": {
	    "env": {
	      "LCP_PROJECT_MONITOR_DYNATRACE_TENANT": "tot02934",
	      "LCP_PROJECT_MONITOR_DYNATRACE_TOKEN": "dDKSowkdID8dKDkCkepW"
	    }
	  }
	}
}
```

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
`LCP_PROJECT_MONITOR_DYNATRACE_TENANT` | A string with eight characters. It is part of the URL (prefix) of your Dynatrace SaaS account. |
`LCP_PROJECT_MONITOR_DYNATRACE_TOKEN` | A string with 22 characters that you can find in your Dynatrace account at *Deploy Dynatrace* &rarr; *Start installation* &rarr; *Set up PaaS monitoring* &rarr; *Installer Download*. |

### Accessing Dynatrace

Now you can access Dynatrace's advanced performance monitoring from the DXP Cloud console:

1. Navigate to a production environment.

1. Click *Monitoring* in the environment menu.

1. Click the *Advanced* tab.

1. Click the *Go to Dynatrace Dashboard* button to access your Dynatrace dashboard.
