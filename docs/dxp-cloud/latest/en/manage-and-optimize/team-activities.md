# Team Activities

Keeping track of activities within each project environment is essential. With Liferay DXP Cloud, you can monitor builds, deployments, and other project activities via the web console.

## Types of Environment Activities

Within each environment, activities are organized into two sections: *Builds and Deployments* and *General Activities*.

**Builds and Deployments**: This section lists all build, deployment, and CI-related activities in a project environment. Each entry includes a Build ID, start time, duration, and status (e.g., in process, successful, failed, interrupted).

**General Activities**: This section lists automated service events and manual team member activities other than build, deployment, and CI activities. General activities include the following categories:

* **Services Activities**: examples include when environment variables are updated, and when services are installed, restarted, or deleted.
* **Settings Activities**: examples include when Support Access is disabled or enabled, and when environment Secrets are added, edited, or viewed by team members.
* **Backup Activities**: examples include when automated or manual backups start, and whether they succeed.
* **Scaling Activities**: examples include when auto-scaling is enabled or disabled, and when the Liferay service is scaled up or downscaled.
* **Membership Activities**: examples include when environment invitations are sent, and when new members join the environment.

Both sections specify the acting team member and the time of the activity.

## Viewing Environment Activities

You can view summaries of recent environment activities from the environment *Overview* page under *Activities*.

Toggle between activity types by clicking on the *Builds and Deployments* or *General* tabs.
