# Multi-Factor Authentication

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all Analytics Cloud users. This additional layer of security helps to protect users from cyberattacks such as phishing and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

## Setting up Multi-Factor Authentication

1. Login to [analytics.liferay.com](https://analytics.liferay.com) with your [liferay.com](https://www.liferay.com) account email address.

    ![Log into Liferay with your user account.](./multi-factor-authentication/images/01.png)

1. Choose from one of the five MFA options. For example, select *SMS Authentication* to receive a code by text message.

   Note, if you choose to change to a different authentication type after setup, please [contact support](#help-with-mfa).

1. Click the *Send Code* button and wait to receive your code. Note, you may need to check your spam folder if using the *Email Authentication* option.
