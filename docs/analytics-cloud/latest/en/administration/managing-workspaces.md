## Managing Project Users

## Tracking Project Usage

As you sync contact and web analytics data from data sources, you must keep an eye on your project’s usage compared to the Liferay Analytics Cloud plan you purchased. The Usage page shows your current usage and describes available plan upgrades and add-ons to address your analytics needs.
