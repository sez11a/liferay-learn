# Using the Inventory Management System

> Availability: Commerce 2.1+

Liferay Commerce's _Inventory Management_ system is a single place for users to manage inventory across an entire Liferay Commerce instance.

Users can add inventory items, view the list of orders for a particular item (SKU), designate Safety Stock, and view historical changes to items. Inventory Management is also tied to the warehouses; from here, users can also view the stock available in each warehouse.

To manage your inventory, navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Inventory_.

## Adding an Inventory Item

Each inventory item is tracked by a SKU<!-- ; this SKU is semi-independent from the SKU created in the product catalog -->. Users can add multiple SKUs in the _Inventory Management_ and ensure that there is adequate quantities for each SKU.

To add an inventory item:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Inventory_.
1. Click the (![Add Icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) icon.
1. Enter the following:

    * **SKU**: CHINAWARE-GRAY
    * **Warehouse**: United States - Southwest
    * **Quantity**: 120

## Viewing Inventory Changes

The Changelog tracks the following events:

* When an order is placed, the quantities are booked (allocated) to fulfill the order.
* When a shipment is created, the previously booked quantity is committed; the inventory is updated by removing the amount previously booked.
* When a quantity is added to the inventory
* When a quantity is moved between warehouses.
* When a shipment is cancelled, the previously allocated quantities need to be returned.
* Any update action to an inventory item.
