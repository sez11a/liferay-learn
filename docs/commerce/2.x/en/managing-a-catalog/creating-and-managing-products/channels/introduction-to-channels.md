# Introduction to Channels

Channels represent a place where products are sold, whether that's a Liferay Commerce based customer portal, a B2B marketplace, or back office phone sales. By connecting sales channels to Liferay Commerce, sellers can manage product content, inventory, orders, and fulfillment across multiple channels in a single place.

To display products and receive orders, a Liferay Commerce instance must have at least one channel.

With multiple channels, you can create more than one Liferay site each with a unique customer experience, connect to third party software or systems, or a combination of both.

Products and discounts can be configured to be available in all channels or specific channels. Similarly, many configurations can be set on the channel level. This includes:

* Category Display Pages
* Notifications
* Order Workflows
* Order Fields
* Payment Methods
* Product Display Pages
* Shipping Methods
* Taxes
* Countries
* Warehouses
