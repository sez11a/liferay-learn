# Introduction to Order Workflows

_Order Workflows_ are a channel-specific setting that, if enabled, require the buyer or seller to give internal prior [approval](./approving-or-rejecting-orders-in-order-workflows.md) for an order before it can be [processed](../orders/processing-an-order.md). To learn more about DXP Workflow in general, see [Introduction to Workflow](https://learn.liferay.com/dxp/7.x/en/process-automation/workflow/user-guide/introduction-to-workflow.html).

**Figure 1**. [Order Life Cycle](../orders/order-life-cycle.md) with both _Approval Workflow_ and _Transmission Workflow_.

Users can activate the _Buyer Order Approval Workflow_, _Seller Order Acceptance Workflow_, or both in their order lifecycle. The Workflows can be used to mirror real world business procedures, such as all orders must be reviewed by an order manager before submission.
