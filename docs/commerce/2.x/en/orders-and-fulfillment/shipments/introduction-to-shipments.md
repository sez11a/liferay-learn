# Introduction to Shipments

Create shipments first in the _Orders_ menu as part of [processing an order](../orders/processing-an-order.md). Once an order is processed, you are redirected to the _Shipments_ menu to complete order processing.

```note::
   A single shipment may contain multiple orders but all the orders must be created by the *same* account.
```

Navigate to _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Orders_. Select an order that is ready to be shipped and click the _Create Shipment_ button.

This takes the user automatically to the Shipments menu to finish processing the order. There are four stages: Processing, Ready to Ship, Shipped, and Delivered.

## Processing

Once all the items and the sourcing warehouse chosen, the order is ready to ship. Here, you can view additional details such as the carrier, tracking number, and estimated delivery date.

 Clicking the _Ship_ button advances the order's process.

Once an order has been shipped and awaiting confirmation of delivery, the order is in the Shipped phase. Click _Deliver_ when the delivery has been made.

Navigate to the _Control Panel_ → _Commerce_ → _Shipments_.

The _Shipments_ menu displays all created shipments in all statuses. Click the Add (![add-icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) button to add a new shipment.

Clicking on a particular shipment number (for example, _41250_) displays the Shipment's _Details_ tab and the _Items_ tab. (Note that clicking the _Order Number_ (_41241_) redirects to the _Orders_ menu.)
