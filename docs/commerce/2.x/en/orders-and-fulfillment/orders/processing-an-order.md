# Processing an Order

Processing an order in Liferay Commerce consists of two stages: accepting an order and processing an order. Shipments are created while orders are processed. To begin processing all orders, including [Subscriptions](../subscriptions/managing-subscriptions.md) (recurring orders), navigate to the [_Orders_ menu](./orders-menu-reference-guide.md) in the _Control Panel_.

## Accepting an Order

Users can accept an order once it has completed the checkout process. Note that if [Order Workflows](../order-workflows/enabling-or-disabling-order-workflows.md) have been enabled, the order must first be reviewed and then [approved (or rejected)](../order-workflows/approving-or-rejecting-orders-in-order-workflows.md). Until the order is reviewed, the order has not completed the checkout process and thus cannot be accepted at this point.

To accept an order:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Orders_.

    ![The Orders menu is in the Control Panel](./processing-an-order/images/01.png)

1. Click the _Open_ tab.
1. Click on the Order ID (for example, _42838_).
1. Click the _Accept Order_ button.

The order has been accepted and can be processed.

## Processing an Accepted Order

After the order has been accepted, there are three options:

* **Cancel**: The order is cancelled and is moved automatically on the Orders menu from the _Pending_ to the _Completed_ tab. The order cannot be edited again and customers must submit a new order.
* **Hold**: Processing the order is temporarily halted until additional actions are taken (for example, the store has to restock low inventory or resolve payment issues).
* **Create Shipment**: The order is ready to be [shipped](../shipments/introduction-to-shipments.md).

### Processing Subscription Orders

You can manage all subscription orders in the _Subscription_ menu in the _Control Panel_.

See the [Managing Subscriptions](../subscriptions/managing-subscriptions.md) article to learn more.

## Creating a Shipment

Creating a shipment begins in the _Orders_ menu as a continuation of processing an accepted order. See the [Creating a Shipment](../shipments/creating-a-shipment.md) article to learn more.

If the order has no shippable items (for example, a service contract or online products), users cannot create a shipment.

## Completed Orders

An order is marked as Completed when the customer has received all the items purchased. (For physical stock, this is usually when the items have been delivered to the customer.) An order is also marked as Completed when it is cancelled. At this point, a Completed order cannot not return to a previous status.

## Commerce 2.0 and Below

Order processing is done in two stages: transmitting an order and creating a shipment.

To process an order:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Orders_.
1. Click on the _Pending_ tab.
1. Click on an order (_40926_).

    ![Click on the Pending Tab to process an order.](./processing-an-order/images/05.png)

1. Click on the _Overview_ tab.
1. Click _Edit Order Status_.

     ![Click on the Pending Tab to process an order.](./processing-an-order/images/06.png)

1. Select _Transmitted_ from the Order Status dropdown menu.
1. Click _Save_ when finished.

The order is then moved to the _Transmitted_ tab. Once an order is transmitted, it is ready to be shipped.
